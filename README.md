Zeno is a general-purpose framework for evaluating machine learning models.
It combines a **Python API** with an **interactive UI** to allow users to discover, explore, and analyze the performance of their models across diverse use cases.
Zeno can be used for any data type or task with [modular views](https://zenoml.com/docs/views/) for everything from object detection to audio transcription.

## Quickstart

Install the Zeno Python package from PyPI:

```bash
pip install zenoml
```

### Command Line

To get started, run the following command to initialize a Zeno project. It will walk you through creating the `zeno.toml` configuration file:

```bash
zeno init
```

Take a look at the [configuration documentation](https://zenoml.com/docs/configuration) for additional `toml` file options like adding model functions.

Start Zeno with `zeno zeno.toml`.

### Jupyter Notebook

You can also run Zeno directly from Jupyter notebooks or lab. The `zeno` command takes a dictionary of configuration options as input. See [the docs](https://zenoml.com/docs/configuration) for a full list of options. In this example we pass the minimum options for exploring a non-tabular dataset:

```python
import pandas as pd
from zeno import zeno

df = pd.read_csv("/path/to/metadata/file.csv")

zeno({
    "metadata": df, # Pandas DataFrame with a row for each instance
    "view": "audio-transcription", # The type of view for this data/task
    "data_path": "/path/to/raw/data/", # The folder with raw data (images, audio, etc.)
    "data_column": "id" # The column in the metadata file that contains the relative paths of files in data_path
})

```

You can pass a list of decorated function references directly Zeno as you add models and metrics.
