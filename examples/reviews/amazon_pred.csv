1,0,I returned it,"Tries to be hip, and isn't. Seems to be put together as a novelty idea. Everyone has an opinion, but I don't see anything here that makes the authors' opinions important. I don't agree with the other reviews. Must be the neighbors writing in. The pros who have been doing it for years and arent looking to be cute and clever do it better.",0

3,0,Changed rating to 5 stars,"This is written by a part time gamer who simply likes to enjoy a game. I find most games are far too difficult for the part time gamer even on the easy setting. All games should have a ""Very Easy"" option. I suspect that there are many others like me who would buy more games if they were not so difficult.The game was fine until Act 3 and then it became unplayable for me because it was too difficult. I thought the rest of the game was great. Because this was frustrating rather than fun I give it a 1 star. If they had a Very Easy selection so that I could actually play the game I would have given it 5 stars..I bought the Guide from Amazon and it helped a lot. I would now rate it 5 stars but Amazon does not seem to allow me to change my rating.",0
4,1,Worked awesome,"I used it on my 1990 Jeep Cherokee. The headliner was like a tent falling. I took out and prepped the headliner board. Then sprayed on the glue as per the directions ""onto foam backing and also onto headliner board"", let it sit for the time stated, spread the new headliner on and it has been perfect ever since. Did it at the end of winter ""Jan 2010"" and it went through a lot of 100+ days during the summer and never came undone. But if you don't follow the directions and put it one before the allotted time it may fail. That is why there are directions on the back of the can. It is a chemical and needs to cure for a certain amount of time so it will adhere to both parts being glued.I love how it came out and I think this glue is excellent.",1
5,1,Franciscan House,"The 1st and the best of the series from, the legend, Mark Farina. Mark starts off with a ""BANG,"" mixing a great batch of jazzy, upbeat songs. It enhances the atmosphere if your listening to it in the summer. He then slowly moves to funk. The greatest, funky songs I have ever heard. San Francisco Sessions is one of the smoothest and best mixes he has ever done. His hand picked selection is almost flawless. He, of course, uses his style of sampling very often and he is the best at it, too. A perfect summer mix that will make you dance.This CD has succeeded all over the globe and to share that success, buy it.",1
6,1,Exceptional Techno Compilation,"This is an excellent CD, filled with interesting and innovative techno tracks. With artists like Thievery Corporation and DJ Madison the CD is sure to be an excellent compliment to the DVD (Released 6-6-05) (http://www.thegodmovie.com)",1
7,0,Not a great book.,"As someone in the business, I had been using Exam Cram and Transcender to gain MCSE. Based on reviews, this book was recommended. However, I didn't particularly care for its style or content. Whereas EC was straight forward and direct, this book tended to be more ""recipe"" checklist than useful for understanding IIS.",0
8,1,Wonderful! Reveiw by a 12 year old,"This is a wonderful book! It tells the story of a young girl who is a preachers daughter and faces always moving from place to place, therefore never having any friends. When Jo moves to Jericho, she finds a new friendship in an unexpected person. She must face the racism in her town and help her friend overcome it and other challenges. This is a wonderful book, for all ages!",1
9,0,Honestly I Just Dont Like ZZ Top,"ZZ Top you hate em or you love em. I dont hate these guys but i just honestly dont like really any of the songs on this album except three, Sharp Dressed Man, LA Garange, and Tush. Every other song on here i really hate ecsepcially, ""Planet Of Woman"", or ""Legs"". ZZ Top all they do is sing about hot women and getting some. Thats there whole basis for there band thats it every song thats what they sing about. Arrggg whats next Journey, ""Be Good To Yourself"", come on people pick up Dark Side Of The Moon instead of this shameless music",0
10,0,A year and that's it!,"We had this crock pot just under a year when it went kaput! Just happened to put in some beans and when my boyfriend came home durring lunch that day he said ""honey, weren't these supposed to be hot by now?"" The heating element is gone and it's no good. I got home that evening and stuck it where it belongs...in the garbage. This crock pot always burned everything, unless it was something like soup or beans with a ton of liquid. I always left the house to work wondering if I might come home to dry and burned food.I've been wanting a new one for a while and now this is just my exuse! I knew it wouldn't last too long. I'm not a fan of the buttons either, they wear out and the sticker starts pulling off. Look elsewhere people! Cheaper ones out there and better! I won't buy anything of this brand again.",0
11,0,Don't waste your time,"Destroyer Command is incredibly buggy, obviously unfinished and the units completely lack any form of intelligence. What you are felt with is something which barely qualifies as a beta version. Ships will ram friendly vessels at will, enemy submarines are incapable of taking offensive *or* defensive action, being perfectly content to sail blissfully along at periscope depth waiting to be destroyed, and enemy ships often ignore the player entirely.Don't waste your money on this rubbish.",0

13,1,Satisfied customer,"The Schwinn 230 Recumbent bike has been an excellent purchase. It is a solid, easy to use and realitively inexpensive excercise bike that my wife and I use regularly. Set up of the bike was not bad, but I did have a problem connecting the electrical wires. As a result, I did not have any power to the console. My call to support was handled pleasantly, and with their help I was able to get the connection working. I haven't had a problem since.",1
14,0,Inadequate description!,The product description does not say whether the mug is microwave/dishwasher safe. There is no information about how many pieces are included in the box. How is a buyer expected to make a purchase?,0
15,1,A great poster,"The poster is big and very colorful. It looks amazing! All the colors look great and the poster was shipped in a rigid box, preventing any damage to the poster. I would buy from this company again.",1
16,1,Im happy with it,"I like this set. It has alot of good stuff included. Just the fact alone that it's a bigger box then the Misfits' coffin box is pretty funny...seems like Glenn is just trying to slap the Misfits in the face by saying ""HA!, my set is bigger!"" The CDs sound good, but the video is kinda cheap. But for the price, you get alot of cool stuff. Misfits are better though.",1
17,0,Great if you only need it to work problem free for 6 months!,This vacuum was great...for about 6 months. Small problems at first - cheap attachments that break easily ... the power cord stops retracting on a regular bases..then the power switch starts getting tricky on you..finally when you plug it in NOTHING. It doesn't turn on anymore and the light that comes on to tell you it's plugged in doesn't light; it isn't the outlet or anything else other that a rip off vacuum. I bought this in September of 2006 - it's in the garbage end of April 2008. So for the past 17 months or so I paid about $10 a month to vacuum my house once a week. That's about a little over $2 each time I used it (and I skipped some weeks.) DO NOT BUY THIS VACUUM. The good reviews come from the people who just bought it and haven't used it long yet.,0
18,1,Grab a seat and DON'T move!!,"Did you say that a MAN wrote this book? Well, believe me, this man has it going on when it comes to an explosive novel about a sister like this book. I laughed, I cried, I cheered, especially when Valerie almost set fire to her husband, Walter. She should have though, in my opinion, and you'll agree, too, when you read the book. Eric Jerome, keep them coming!!",1
19,1,Sippie cup saver.,Playtex spill-proof cups are worth their weight in gold to any parent with toddlers. The cup is only as good as the valve though. I had 2 cups that were pretty much useless without working valves. I was so happy to not have to throw these cups away. I ordered 2 packs as more valves are surely to go bad over time.,0

25,1,Great for dogs big and small,"This leash is a miracle. We are on our 3rd dog but have used a leash like this for our last 2 dogs. We have had a cocker spanel, lab and the one we have right know our little Max a Terrier Mix. The lab we got when she was a puppy and ended up giving her back because we were not redy for a dog. This leash has nots and is worn out but is still a great leash. Max loves to run he can out run our golfcart which can go up to 25 m.p.h.So as you can see this is a great leash.",1
26,0,Outdated and Disappointing,"Traveled in Costa Rica a month ago with this book and was very disappointed. The information in the book is badly outdated. My travel companion had the Lonely Planet Guide to Costa Rica, which was much better. My advice is to go with the LP Guide to Costa Rica",0
27,0,"Bad language, much information","As the other reviewers say, it is obvious that the author as put alot of work into this book. It is huge.However, the author could have spent more time making it more readable. The writing is not good: sentences are often not comprehensible, and the punctuation is often confusing. In one passage, he tries to explain addition modulo 2, and says that the rule ""1+1=0"" is ""inspired by the fact that odd+odd=even"". It *is* precisely that fact, it is not merely ""inspired"" by it.In addition to the bad language, he often omits proofs, and is not rigorous in his definitions. The notation is often confusing.Certain parts of the book are good though - but only after reading them three or more times to understand what is really being said.",0

29,1,Classic songs in a nice movie format,"My babysitter brought all of the WeeSing videos over and our kids and the whole neighborhood love to watch, sing and dance to them.",1
30,0,Not Punk Rock,"If this album had been billed as a pop album, I might have been inclined to give it a higher rating. However, Blink bills themselves as punks, which they are sadly not. All the songs on Dude Ranch (with the possible exception of Adam's Song) are as bubble gum as Britney Spears despite the fact that their authors have tatoos and dyed hair. Rarely is their a song that is more superficial than ""What's my Age Again?"". Maybe blink will eventually be hailed as great pop artists, however, they will never be in the same leauge as Punk bands like The Clash, The Sex Pistols, Social Distortion, or the Ramones. In my opinion, they will always be categorized with other bland, no-message pop artists. A great Punk album ""Dude Ranch"" is not.",0
31,1,Easy Link Characters are great!,Great item - very durable - super fun and cute. My kids love Easy Link and it's too bad FP discontinued it. SUPER tool and the characters are fabulous. Websites are easy to navigate through (my almost 2.5yrs old is in love with this product!). Bit pricey now that it's discontinued - shop around to see if you can find cheaper...,1
32,1,Sherman Foundations and Interval Spin,"I rode the Foundations course and found that I was within my target heart rate for 24 minutes total. Instructor gives encouragement and tips for staying focused on the ride. If you turn off the lights and spin, its almost the same as being in a live class.",1
33,1,A Useful Tool,"This is a very practical, useful book for teachers working with writers grades 4-8. The 4-square method offers a simple, yet innovative graphic organizer which my students (7th grade reg. ed. and grades 5-8 learning dis./lang. impaired) found extremely easy to understand and use. The method is also helpful in notetaking from text or narrative, and the authors give some lesson ideas across curriculums.The graphics are serviceable, but seem more appropriate for younger students.",1

35,1,The best prep book for the new SAT essay!,"I was scarred to death when I heard about the new essay on the SAT. I bought this book, and it was a life saver! I would definantly recommend it to anyone looking for a great prep book for the essay on the new SAT.",1
36,0,"Has a great first run, then watch out!","I was on cloud 9 with this product for about a week: wma compatible, nice headphones, etc. Then I needed to change the battery, and all hell broke loose. The backpack failed to snap back on after replacing the battery, then the off/on switch snapped and wouldn't work anymore. Within a week, this had turned into one useless product. So I took it back and exchanged it for the Intel 3000: it may look a little clunkier and the headphones aren't as nice, but it's been great so far, and I haven't had any problems changing batteries.Buyer beware!",0

Maybe Bradley will see this review and send me some bisquettes--hear that Bradley??",0
38,1,Best purchase from Garmin yet,"I am not your typical runner. I mainly run to maintain my physical fitness requirements with the Air Force. This unit saved me from having to be retested.This unit has the ability to enter in the distance you wish to run and the amount of time you want to run it in. When you press start, a little man appears and below him shows your distance in front of or behind him.One issue I have always had was keeping a steady pace. I, like most others, start off too fast and don't have enough steam at the end. While using this unit I have seen a drastic change in my endurance by keeping my pace steady.This GPS also does so much more than I thought possible, much of which I will never use, but it is good to know that it is there if I do.I HIGHLY recommend this unit to both the trained and un-trained athlete. I don't think you will be disappointed.",1
39,0,Detoxifying.,"This is a terrible single for a decent, catchy song. Sonically, the remixes fall flat because they do not really suit the song. If you want a really good remix, download K.O.'s Level 5 Toxicity mix instead of buying this.",0
40,1,Helpful guide for Texans as well as visitors to Texas,"Laurence Parent's ""Official Guide to Texas StateParks"" is a practical and beautiful presentationof the rich variety of public-accessiblelands of Texas. Divided into seven areas, itgives succinct but helpful descriptions of parksin ""Big Bend Country"", ""Gulf Coast"",""Hill Country"", ""Panhandle Plains"",""Piney Woods"", ""Prairies and Lakes"",and ""South Texas Plains"". There are beautifulcolor photographs of most of the parksand just enough history and information towhet your appetite to see it, (but notenough to make you feel you've seen it,so why bother?) I am ordering copies for myTexas grandchildren to present, along witha Texas roadmap and a promise of bothdaytrips (from the Houston area) andcamping trips in the near future. This isa great reference book as well asjust entertaining reading.",1
41,0,Less than thrilled,"I bought this radio because of the promise of great reception, sound and simple interface. After trying it for 2 weeks, I sent it back. The reception was not better than any other radio -- in fact, it's worse than the 30 year old clock radio I'm replacing. The antenna connector couldn't have been designed more awkardly, making it difficult to connect different antennas (to improve its poor reception). The FM antenna provided is minimal and cheap. Also, I didn't like the button interface. To use the preset channels, for example, you have to DIAL from 1 to 10...can't hop from preset 1 to preset 8, have to scroll thru all. Snooze button was hard to use, had to press a certain way, very hard, not user friendly. Clock numbers were smaller than average clocks, so harder to see if you wear glasses during day. Sound was good on stations I could get...but wasn't vastly better than any other radio. All in all, a huge disappointment.",0
42,0,BATTERY COST TOO EXTREME AND DNOT LONG LASTING,I have had these wristwatch 2 way gmrs radios and purchased a battery. These batterys do not last long and go dead in about a year. The cost is $18.00 plus shipping to replace a battery. Well you can buy a new set of radios complete for that on ebay. So why are these batterys so extreamly expensive? I do not know. Anyway i got rid of the radios that use these batterys. These are not recommended and is my opinion as a user of this product. These should last as long as a standard cell phone battery and cost only a few dollars. Not recommended at all.TOYTREKER,0
43,1,Ruby,It was a nice series. I have read Snelling before and enjoyed her books. Her family connection in the series worked well.,1
44,0,A step in the wrong direction,"Life the Universe and Everything, book 3 in the hitchhikers triogy (which actually has FIVE books)was quite different then the first two. While the first books had lighthearted yet well developed plots, the plot in LUE (Life the Universe and Everything)was darker less well developed, and very unorigonal (I mean come on, saving the universe is so passe). I was also very dissapointed with the humor. While it had it's monents, LUE had less humorous portions and most of the humor seemed very out of context and had nothing to do with the plot. The ending was also very anti-climactic, not having a cliffhanger like the previous boooks. Overall it is a dissapointment compared to the rest of the series but is neccessary to read to get the whole plot of the series. I recommend it to only those who are going to read the rest of the series.",0
45,1,Excellent Information for Would-Be Handloaders,"Terrific treatise on commercial manufacture of cases, primers, powders, and bullets. Includes detailed descriptions of various reloading tools and how they are used in reloading handgun, rifle, and shotgun cartridges. However, minor callout errors appear on some illustrations, and the section on handloading mathematics may contain inaccuracies. Otherwise, I highly recommend this book.",1
46,0,An Invitation to Seduction,"I really enjoyed To Marry an Heiress and naturally thought I would like this book but I didn't. Robert and Kitty character were hard to connect.I found Robert a little to arrogant and shallow. Althought Kitty was a kind and sweet person, she worried about society and mother past too much.Was this review helpful?",0
47,0,Road to Nowhere,"This book contains very little on Pres. McKinley or Pres. Roosevelt, but focuses more on the life and trial of Leon Czolgosz, McKinley's assassin. This might be interesting if there was a story to it. There isn't. Why did Czolgosz kill the President? He was doing his duty, to quote Czolgosz. Wow! That is exciting reading! The majority of this book is psyco-babble trying to understand why a person would kiil the president, or how or why American society changed to create anarchists.There is nothing to analyze here. the heart of man is wicked and these things have and will continue to happen because mankind is fallen and we live in a fallen world.From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members? (James 4:1 KJV)",0

51,1,~~another realistic teen read by Dessen~~,"I'm in my mid 30's now and every one of Dessen's books that I've read reminds me of my own youth. In this book Remy, our main character, learns lessons in allowing herself to love and be loved and how much she's missing out on by closing herself off to someone that might really love her. Great story, great characters and most of all a great lesson to be learned! For those sensitive to foul language, underage drinking and premarital sex, you might not appreciate the story for what it is. Just FYI.",1
52,1,Saga keeps going,Saga continues to create excellent music after almost 30 years and I recommend Trust to old and new fans alike. It still bewilders me why they sell out shows in Europe but haven't toured North America since 1986.,1
53,1,The best easter book ever!,This was my absolute favorite book as a child! It's really one of the only ones I remember besides my Mother Goose book. I bought it for my step-daughter and she loved it as well. It's such a sweet book with pictures that will stay in a child's memory forever.,1
54,0,Like sleeping on canvas,"I soaked the sheets like another reviewer suggested and it made no difference. I washed them twice before sleeping on them just to remove the smell, as they smell like they are made of recycled tires. Much like everything made in china they look better than they actually are.",0
55,0,bad script,"Two great actors with a really bad script, there was no suspense or a build up to understand why the characters did what they did. Both actors would have been better off playing against each other, De Niro should have played the part that Leguizamo played. The ending was bad, bad ,bad.",0
56,1,Superb,I first read this book as a Sophomore in high school and loved it. I bought it a few days after I finnished reading it. This is truly a great book. The imagery and characterization Nix uses to bring his characters and the setting to life is truly brilliant. This is a book for all ages!,1
57,0,You must acquire a taste for this type of opera,"If you are an operatic intelligentsia or a lover of Baroque opera you will rate this 5 stars. Yes you have to acquire a taste for this type of opera. I am the average opera lover having seen about 140 operas in my life....and this simply is not to my taste. I am glad this was only the 3 hour version by Copley. First not sure why they had everyone in Baroque costumes including Cleopatra, disconcerting to have Julius Caesar sung by a female, Ptolemy was dressed like a clown, and not a fan of counter-tenors and incessant recitatives like in a mass. The entire opera was stodgy. Video and sound quality were excellent. I have never heard an opera before Mozart that I enjoyed. Never-the-less I am glad I saw and heard it...I can cross that off my bucket list.",0

59,1,"To this day, my favorite","This has to be the greatest work the original Danzig had ever produced. Everything from Glenn's resounding voice, Chuck's crushing drums, Eerie's heavy bass lines, and John's devestating guitar riffs combined together flawlessly to open a portal into a darker world filled with demons, lust, and disdain for light. All while avoiding the trappings that other bands of this vein (snicker) have fallen into. THE must have disc for anyone who has ever had that twinkling of something dark and frightening in their eye.",1

61,0,Snake's Opoinion,"Now unlike many of the other readers for Grapes of Wrath, I disliked most of the book. Yes it does tell the story of the migrant workers in California. And yes John Stienbeck is descriptive. In my opinion the way his writing is completely bored me. I had to literally force myself to read this book it was so boring. It was far sure way to long and also a very slow reading book. This book bored me so much that I would fall asleep when reading it. Every now and then there was a good chapter but mostly pretty boring of a book. His writing is not nearly as interesting as other authors. Stienbeck is considered a great author, but not really to me. Save yourself some pain and do not read this book unless you have to!",0
62,1,Nice little gun !,"This driver is without equal for it's intended use. It is an example of how Black and Decker / Dewalt make great screwdrivers. Like the Pivot Driver PD600 on the consumer side of the aisle, the DW920K-2 is my new favorite tool. I bought several of these reconditioned and recently two new from Amazon for a great price. The metal gearbox and hinge say quality from the start. The control is great as well. The one hour charger and two batteries top this great kit off.Just like the other guys say when they review. I too now have that GO TO TOOL. Makes a great general purpose drill as well. One of my favorite Dewalts. Yep !",1

65,1,Great clean smoking wood,This is some of the best smoking wood chunks around. I actually ordered these chunks as part of doing a product survey for my website. These chunks were clearly in the top tier of the 8 brands that I tested. They are relatively expensive with shipping but you get what you pay for.,1
66,1,"Great performance, great human story.","I found this to be a very powerful movie. Some of the reviewers didn't like the fact that there was no happy ending, but I for one loved the ending. It lets the audience draw its own conclusion, which I love.Tom Hanks' performance is amazing, and in a role where the lead actor must carry the movie for an hour while only talking to a volleyball, he is great. I also like this movie for the way the special effects are used. Watch the extras on the second DVD to find out. I prefer special effects that help tell the story, such as this or something like Terminator 2, where the menace of the T-1000 needs the special effects to come to fruition. It clearly shows up movies such as The Phantom Menace, where the special effects are the story. And they made for a bad story.All in all, watch the movie, then watch the extras, then watch the movie again. It will give new respect to the words movie magic.",1

I have to redip my pliers every week and then they are out of action for 24 hours becuase I let them dry for that length of time. The coating peels off after just a couple of days use.

Spotty, inaccurate and so full of the filmmaker's lame-brained and asinine opinions that it will make you want to throw things. Cobbled together with footage from God knows where, this poor excuse for a film is an agonizing exercise in plain stupidity. It's not even remotely entertaining. If you absolutely must see this, borrow it from a library and watch it first before you buy. The box says 'Collector's Edition DVD' but they really mean 'Completist.'

75,0,Midwest Cook found ingredients to spicy,"I guess I didn't think bold would be hot and spicy in every recipe, I cook a lot and love fresh vegies and grilling recipes, I have a vast variety of ingredients in my cabinets but could not conjure up enough for even one of these in this book. Too much work, really a disappointing selection. I will stick to Martha Stewart and Susan Branch, more my style.",0
76,1,Now I Understand What Hadrons Are,"While not as funny as other stories featuring Feynman, these collected lectures go over the relationship between science, doubt, philosophy, and teaching. They also do a great job of explaining QED (Quantum Electro-Dynamics, what Feynman shared a Nobel Prize for) and quarks in terms a layman can understand. After reading, I understand what the Hadron super-collider is trying to experimentally prove.If you enjoy science, physics especially, this is an excellent work. Two or three of the chapters are on the dry side, which is what keeps it off five stars from me.",1
77,0,What?!! No Call Waiting Caller ID?!?,"I bought this product because my old caller ID does not support call waiting caller id! According to the product description, it says it supports call waiting, little did I know, that's all it supports. But don't all units/phones support call waiting? What I'm saying is that this unit doesn't even support call waiting caller id---only regular caller id! I don't even know why they had to throw the term ""call waiting"" on the item description because it totally misleads consumers! So basically, my money was put to waste. I gave it two stars though because I liked the large display, easy to see the caller's name.I'm still looking out for a good caller id unit/box that supports call waiting caller id. It seems very rare and I don't want to buy a new phone just so I can use the feature. Don't buy this if you want a box that supports the new call waiting caller id feature, because this product obviously does not support it!",0
78,1,Imagine...greatness!,"""Imagine a Day"" is a simple but provocative book. The detailed paintings, neatly framed by white borders, belong on gallery walls. The text that accompanies each painting is spare but sometimes hits just the right note, making the pictures all the more stirring and awe-inspiring. The final painting, picturing books within a library, is the perfect illustration for what the book itself is and what every book a child opens can be. Teachers seeking textual sources for their students' creative writing will likely find this title, like Chris Van Allsburg's ""The Mysteries of Harris Burdick,"" an excellent resource.",1
79,1,Great bang for the buck!,"Simply can't be beat at this price! This scale is well built and easily competes with models 3-5x the cost. Feels a little cheap (lightweight plastic) but works just fine. I really like the bright, easy to read display (thinking about picking up a few for my local dispensary). Only thing I wish it had was two decimal places but when you're talking grams, that's really splitting hairs (pun not intended). I would recommend this as a smart starter scale for your average MMJ user. I am happy with mine.",1

84,1,My Mistake,It is an excellent book on the FE and FT big block Fords. I should have taken the time to load the cover page so I could see the fact that it does not cover ALL Ford big blocks.

85,0,A Vampirologist sceptic....are you serious?,"This man attempted to make a career out of ""debunking"" the Amityville story.Was he there? No.Did he try to get involved, but was rejected for his less than believable credentials? Yes.Did he try to make money off the case? Well, this book should answer that question.Was he a skeptical ""vampirologist"".....really? I'm always stunned when the ""skeptical"" answer is less believable than the supernatural answer. In any case, as the Lutzes and people that were actually involved in the case attested, the book and movie were both exaggerated by the creative people. Seems pretty honest to me. Still, the Lutzes seemed honestly sincere and believable in every interview I saw. This loser who was in no way involved, has no business telling the people actually involved what they say. He doesn't know. He wasn't there. And neither was his wife. Loser.",1

94,1,Good book,"The Satanic Bible was written in 1969 and so isn't totally up to date on certain things. The rituals in it are only an outline, and most Satanist write their own these days. The Enochian keys are a waste of paper to me, I never use them. But, the key part of the book, the most importan part, are The Book Of Lucifer (part 2) and The Book Of Belial (part 3) as these are the parts that truly describe what Satanism is. The rest is basically page filler. Those 2 parts of the book aren't very long, but when I first read them, I relialized who I was and it changed my way of seeing the world forever. R.I.P.

95,0,Amazingly TERRIBLE movie...SO SO BAD!,"What is amazing about this terrible movie is that the movie itself was well-executed. There was suspense, and the acting was well done. However, the story line was...non-existant? There was zero character development, and the audience was not compelled to care about anything in the movie even momentarily. And then, the movie just ended...stupidly. This was so bad that it's not even a rental. It is just breathtakingly terrible and is completely irredeemable. So so bad.Everyone leaving the theater was making fun of the member of their party who had chosen the movie. People were saying things like, ""Was that as bad as I thought it was?"" and ""J-Lo should have been in this one."" That pretty much says it all.",0

101,0,Switchblade : The Ace Of Blades,Don't bother with this one. The illustrations are poor and there should have been more photographs of interesting knives. The material is very general and sketchy. A book that goes into a great amount of detail on any particular part of the subject would be more interesting and useful. I think most people would prefer a book showing in detail the mechanics of switchblades and some of the pattent drawings. A book about collectable button knives and their values might be popular too. I would like to read more about the Estes Kefauver and the motivations of other people in office that write and pass stupid laws regulating pocket knives.,0

While she thinks a very few of the hand's positions look unnatural, she is impressed with the book.I've had trouble with hands, so I'm eager to dive into this book. Her other books have always helped me. By the way, on reason some people have trouble with Lee Hammond's techniques are simply because they don't buy the supplies she lists! These supplies are very important towards improving your work. The money will be worth it. In fact, I would suggest ALL of Lee Hammond's books. I've seen most of them. If you interested in drawing people, I would suggest How to Draw Life-like Portraits from Photographs the most of all her people books. It covers more than her other book, has everything. The results are amazing. And the techniques you learn here will help you in all future drawing!!!",1

What a refreshing change to see a female character in a child's book who, for once, isn't little miss perfect and actually behaves like children sometimes do. There seems to be so much fuss over Olivia's fib in this book but I wish parents would give their children *some* credit - they're not stupid. The children I work with all have fun laughing about how big a fib Olivia told and why it isn't a good thing to do. Children know right from wrong on these things, but it can be wicked good fun to laugh along with a character they know is behaving a little naughtily.",1

116,1,excellent new edition of Hind Swaraj,"This excellent new edition of Hind Swaraj fulfills the needs of all readers, either for private and academic purposes. Extraordinary is especially the introduction which covers all major subjects which should be taken into account for understanding ""Hind Swaraj"", e.g. wesetern and eastern influences on Gandhis thoughts, the London & South African years etc. The text itself is issued with a lot of explaining footnotes which also refer on the original (written in Gujarati). It's so far the first edition I know which compares between the english and gujatati text ! The only, minor manko might be the fact that the South African years are treated rather short, but the bibliography and advices for further reading lead the ambitious reader to new sources.",1

118,1,Decent action movie with super Cindy,"The story is illogical. Cindy is a busy lawyer and Baldwin is the cop and some ex KGB agents with absurd reasons are hunting her down. But who really cares about the plot once the chase begin. Cindy Crawford's good look is enough to sit through this silly but rather enjoyable action movie. Another bonus is you can see a glimpse of Cindy changing her T shirt and a brief love scene. The downside, the DVD is in full screen and no other special features. I also bought a region 3 version and it is in wide screen and also in Dolby 5.1 and it is playable in region 1 players so if you insist of having to see this movie in WS you can get the region 3 version instead.",1

124,1,Big Fan of JG,I'm a big fan of Julie Garwood and read many of her books. But this one is definitely my #1 favorite. I love the way that Johnana overcame her fears and regained confidence with the help of her soul mate. I also like her candid and honest manner in which she took the stubborn warrior's heart. The scene that she talked about her archangel Gabriel in front of her ex-husband brought me tears.... Pick up the book and you never regret it!!!,1

The memoir, graphic yet factual, accounts Wladyslow Szpilman&#65533;s feelings and living conditions in the Warsaw ghetto. The strength of his motivation to survive the horrors of the holocaust are gripping and inspiring. The book The Pianist remains one of the best books I have ever read.

I now know how to (and do) encourage and support myself in shifting my life impulses from the track of fear to the track of freedom. There are many other gifts that have come from reading this book. I used to think I did not have time for any of the things I really wanted to do. Now, I know I have time.

139,1,Country kitsch in Colorado,"This book reminds me of the ""country kitsch"" style that was in vogue a few years ago -- cute, too cute. Seriously, this is a small town romance where the greatest obstacle to Sophie and Zeke's happiness is their own pride. It's cute for awhile but there were times I just wanted to knock their heads together and tell them to wake up.Fans of Pamela Morsi will probably enjoy this book. It's pretty well written -- enough to win a Reviewer's Choice Award from Romantic Times. Besides, it may well be the only book ever set in Rocky Ford, Colorado -- a small town on the eastern prairie that grows the most wonderful melons.",1
140,0,Terribly Pro-NY/Frazee,"I received Red Sox Century expecting a comprehensive, fair look at the tumultuous history of my favorite team. Instead, I received a book written by New Yorkers, ostensibly for New Yorkers. The chapter on Harry Frazee and the sale of Ruth manages to fail in a completely unique way: by somehow ignoring Frazee's destruction of the Red Sox.The writers continually gloss over the ramifications of the deals, failing to explain how poorly they turned out for his own team. In an objective book, I'd imagine the trade of one of the best hitting catchers in baseball and a 20 year old future hall of famer for 4 journeyman would merit a mention. Not so here.Any baseball book that passes off honest criticism as anti-semitism is not worth getting. Save your money.",0
141,0,"Mostly tedious, with interesting parts","I found the writing interesting, and the subject fascinating, but I found myself frustrated by the author's difficulty in talking directly about the status of Muslim women with her interview subjects. The author spent many pages writing about the menus and dress of the many middle and upper-middle class women she interviewed. It seemed as though her interview subjects resisted her efforts to discuss the status of women in their countries, so we too as readers had to wade through much distracting material and misunderstandings about feminism and gender. Great travel stories, but not a great source of information about Muslim women.",0

Very different, very thought-provoking, and, best of all, very entertaining.",1

He points out that the reason for the reunion is not important, it's all about the music.Since many Cream fans were not around for the original genius and for decades it looked like we could never witness one of the best bands ever, this would be worth any price to own.The beauty of the music is Eric/Jack/Ginger are not going through the motions. The energy level is high, there is fun in their eyes, and with all the health issues Jack Bruce in his 60's still has vocal pipes that can move a mountain.I went down to the crossroads and think I'll stay for awhile.Thanks to a power trio that has made my life fuller.",1

157,0,a rehash of old people and newsweek articles,"I was extremely disappointed with this book. If you have read any old articles on JFK Jr. in People magazine or Newsweek, you have read this book. Plus, the author lifted most of information from earlier written books on Jackie. The first and last chapter were the only chapters spent on the day John died. The rest of the chapters are on how Jackie raised John. I could have clipped out articles from People, Newsweek and the Enquirer, thrown in old photos and written this book.",0

How can they continue to mistreat big properties like the universal monsters? Find some people who can make a monster movie...please. The originals are good because they were taken serious with top notch talent and money.,0

It has a good story that keeps your interest. Although the picture quality of this blu ray is excellent, the sound steals the show. Those with a capable speaker setup (especially the sub) will benefit the most. In the first scene it sounded and felt like the canon ball was going straight through my room. There are even times where it seems like things were gonna fall on my head. If you've never seen this movie, I would rent it first.

175,1,A wonderful blend of the western and magical realism genres.,"Midori Snyder, who has done wonders with her traditional fantasies, has decided to blend two rather contrary styles. She takes the traditional, down-to-earth stylings of a western novel, and throws in some sensual, and occasionally bizarre, touches of magical realism. Along the way we also get a healthy dose of urban fantasy, as Snyder tells the tale of a young man growing up in 19th century New York who discovers that he has a much richer and more magical heritage than he had assumed. Snyder takes a classic plot -- a mortal sired by faeries -- and makes it shine",1

The author makes the case that capitol punishment is wrong because the poor and ignorant aren't properly defended in criminal court and are, therefore, likely to be unjustly condemned. 300 extra pages of redundant prose ensue. Some of McCrumb's recurring characters appear here and there, doing nothing to thicken the plot.",0

Shrek is almost ridiculously Non violent. You can punck and kick until you're green in the face, but everything gets back up. Normally, when you play blood bath games like Halo or Max Payne you come away from it feeling relaxed and calm, agressions out. However, play Shrek for a half hour you're going to want to take out a Glock and mow down a line of people at a post office. So parents don't buy your kids this game, buy them Max Payne or Blood wake, now that's therapy.Oh yeah, and P.S., I don't kbnow what game the people who wrote the product description played, but Shrek only has 8 levels and there are no between level cut scenes.",0

(sorry, terrible humor!)","I have just finished reading ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"", and think that it is an excellent book for anyone that will be patient enough to read it. It reads similar to the Lord of the Rings, which also goes into great detail about the scenery ect... However, unlike Lord of the Rings this book takes you UNDER the ground and in the 1800s and therefore does not have mythological or middle-earth dialogue. I did not like how it seemed the Uncle was ""all knowing"" and Harry was always surprised about everything constantly.

That's all I can say. It left my skin extremely smooth and removed all the hair on my legs with great ease! NO bumps, NO pain, just smooth hair free legs. I'm definitely going to continue to use this product. I have even told me friends about it who are now going to buy one. I was skeptical at first but this product amazed me! Even my boyfriend was amazed! I did both of my legs, upper and lower in about half an hour. I barely used any pressure when applying it to my legs. The key is DON'T press it hard - just glide it along your skin and it will work. I also used it on my arms and bikini area and it worked wonderfully! Like I said, this product is definitely worth keeping! Just make sure to read the instructions and do not apply too much pressure or else it won't work at all and you'll be left with rough bumpy irritated skin.",1

Even though there are a lot of the same faces, there are still a lot. It's going to take you a while to work your way through them anyway, and for the amount of songs there, it is a good deal. Good songs, too, just in case you're worried (i.e. no Mexican Hat Dance).",1

202,1,"""Theory"" of comics","This is a book on comics ""theory"", as in ""music theory"". It is exactly what the title claims: a breakdown and analysis of what comics do, as a communication medium, and how they do it. McCloud examines comics as they are now and demonstrates-believably-how comics operate in ways that text alone cannot. For example, it isn't a history of comics or a how-to book for aspiring comics artists, but McCloud does show different ways of drawing the same thing, and points out how each different style carries a slightly different message for the reader. So the same aspiring comics artist won't learn how to draw from this book, but he or she could learn how better to make the point he or she is trying to make. This book is a serious, thoughtful, clear, and well-researched essay presented as a comic book.",1

So I decided to buy the album and I just loved it. It's a great mix of pop and rock and it's just really really good.

Odessey is probably the most beautifully crafted psychedelia this side of Love's Forever Changes, a disc which plays in my head for many hours after just one listening. It even has a story line that constantly re-plots itself according to your mood. Absolutely in my Top Five after only 10 days of listening, and I'd bet it will still hold rank after 20 years!

215,0,Old wine in a new bottle.,"I found this book to be unfocused, and the title, misleading. It's repeated description of the Yorubas and their religion as ""pagans"" and ""paganism"" is a throwback to the 18th century. The chapter, ""Making Country Fashion"", which takes an 18th century ""pidgin english"" phrase by ""Saro"" returnees and applies it to the Yoruba religion patently trivializes the religion. His translation of Yoruba words and phrases, in many instances, is erroneous or misleading. His conclusions, in many instances are unsupported or at best tenuous. For instance, his confident ""certainty"" that the Ifa divination system was derived from Islamic geomancy. He also dredges up old controversies, such as the existence, or lack thereof, of one God in Yoruba religion. In conclusion, this book contributes nothing to the discourse, and is a waste of money.",0

Overall, I am very pleased and would recommend this unit.",1
218,1,Better over time,"I like this movie more now than I did the night I first saw it. Back then, the flashbacks irritated me, Julianne Moore's aborted presence frustrated me because I knew she'd done more, and the whole concept of Kimble's primary nemesis not being the one-armed man but a friend and colleague (the cynical 90s -- betrayal and conspiracy) still rankles.Nevertheless, the intelligence of Kimble and Girard, and the taut pacing, make this one thriller that I really can't help but enjoy seeing often. (I only hope that Ford one day receives the career recognition that Jones already has. True, it was Jones' lacing his character with flashes of wit that likely earned him the Oscar, but Ford's intensity and the empathy he draws from the viewer are also admirable and contribute greatly to the movie's impact.)",1

220,0,Too basic,"The book title is misleading. I thought it would be comprehensive, including scales, chords etc. However, too much of the book is devoted to extremely basic guitar questions, ie how to tune, clean and hold your guitar. Not enough material about playing the guitar.",0

Some nimrods may do themselves well to learn this)",0
224,1,Great,"Ok, so this movie may have lacked a lot of elements that make movies great movies great, but it did have something most high-budget movies don't, a good plot. Ok, so I know it was about aliens who try to take over the world in a very inefficient way (the could only blow-up one building at a time) and lots of other things of that nature, but it did it in a believeable way. The actors held the script together. And maybe it was silly, but isn't that what movies are all about? Who wants to see a movie about how bad life really is?",1
225,1,Great book for beginners,"I am currently a high school student hoping to become a Marine when I graduate high school.This book gave me all the info I needed about joining the marines, plus a great workout.I reccomend this book to both future marines and those who do not plan on joining the marines for the workout program.What I liked most about the workout program that is unique to most other programs that it is tailored to your specific needs and the RUNNING part is great. This book has a 4 week program that starts you out Jogging for 1 minute/walking for 4 minutes and you do that 4 times. 4 weeks later, it has you running for 30 minutes and it works up progressivly, this is a GREAT workout and I was really impressed with my results.",1

The questions often had to be repeated, and almost everyone was confused about the rules. The thing about this game is that only one person can win--they tried to make it so it's cutthroat, but it just doesn't work. The questions might have been good, had they been phrased in a less ambiguous way--my friend knew most of the music questions, after the answer had been said and she finally understood what it had been asking. Try this game if you want, but be warned that it may take the life out of a crowd.",0

231,0,How to Win Friends and Influence People,"The new book came on time and as ordered but the quality was very poor. The pages were light yellow, stiff, and most important of all, there was little room on the binding side so the book would not stay open or even come close to staying open, making it difficult to comfortably read. Surprisingly it was made in the US.",0
232,1,Millennium Party!,Yet another musical gift from Wynonna with glorious harmonies provided by mama Naomi! For years I've dreamed of hearing that live sound on record and now it's come true. Wynonna's voice is gorgeous and flexible as ever. The songs move from sweet to frivilous to painful to joyful. The old and new songs are all good enough to be hits in today's market because they're so timeless.There's the added bonus of the crowd that it makes you feel like you're in Phoenix partying into the new millennium with the girls. The fan interaction and verbal barbs Wynonna and Naomi throw at one another were also captured reflecting the true nature of the live shows we love so much. Snap this one up as soon as possible. If you have no other Wynonna or Judds records this one is a great start. Happy groovin'!,1
233,1,Great book.,"This book reminded me of A Beautiful Mind, in that it helped me develop a deeper understanding of how somone with Schizophrenia might be feeling and how it is for families to have a member with this illness.",1
234,0,good idea...poor solution,"I had just bought a new bike. The usual ""penal numbness"" from the saddle. All the other ""anatomically correct"" saddles that I saw on the market (lots of them) were way too expensive. This ""No Pressure"" seat was within my budget. Quick, easy sale; quick, easy delivery. Schwinn was partially correct, there is no numbness, HOWEVER, at least in my case, my thighs kept rubbing against the saddle. After trying a variety of saddle-to-post adjustments, I finally put the original saddle back on, got out my trusty penknife and cut the padding out of the horn. This home made remedy did the trick.",0

236,1,Great book,"My son had to read this book over the summer for school. We read it together as I had seen part of the movie as a kid. It was really good. We both enjoyed it very much and I had to fight off tears a couple of times. We then watched the movie, it doesn't do the book justice but it was great to see all those famous 80's actors together.",1
237,0,Okay,pretty decent.. but i think one can learn a lot just by watching movies and reading a lot of comics and then analyzing them.. that way you acquire your own taste and preference in how to tell a story,1

239,0,Many Poor Design Decisions,"1) The iPod Mini will not connect as long as the adapter is installed. Instead, I need to remove the adapter and let it wobble there on the top. 2) There is no way to push the side buttons without first feeling for the correct button, then gripping the entire unit. Pressing the buttons without full grip only pushes the iH4 to the side.3)Gives the impression that it includes the remote, but doesn't.4) The display is too bright and sports high intensity LEDs to add to the illumination.5) Sleep (the best feature of iHome units) is a small button rather than a large bar like snooze.",0

241,0,Not so impressed,"I was disappointed that when I would dial digits on my phone I could always hear static in the blue tooth. Then the unit would not hold a charge. I sent an e-mail to the address listed for the company on the Amazon website and it has been over a week and no one has responded. I finally ended up calling the manufacturer and they said that if I filled out some paperwork, they would replace it. I assume this will happen this week.",0

244,1,Meet James Bond,"FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE while being the second in the series to DR. NO is the first in which the James Bond popular culture came to know and love makes his appearance and is often considered the best of them all. Sean Connery plays Bond a bit different from the character on the pages of Ian Fleming spy novels as well as turning in an improved performance over his previous effort in DR. NO. Connery made a Bond better fit for the screen, giving the character more personality, more charisma and humor than Fleming's buttoned-up, bland English gentleman spy. As one co-producer of the Bond films says,""We always start out trying to make another FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE and end up with another THUNDERBALL"". Well, THUNDERBALL is just another good Sean Connery Bond action film while FROM RUSSIA.. is film classic.",1

248,0,Are We Not Ticked? This is Sucko.,"In the DVD commentary for The Truth About Devolution and the Giffels/Dellinger book, Jerry mentioned wanting to do a new version of Devo similar to the current pop tarts out there. Rather than run the idea through with a coat hanger before it had a chance to come to fruition, take the subversive/sexual content of Devo's canon, dilute with the Mickey Mouse Club and you get this piece of steaming, putrid you know what.Considering the band did back-up on these songs, would it really have been that hard simply to update their own songs for the 21st century without bringing in a bunch of kids who weren't even born when the last proper Devo CD came out? Of course not. Instead, they hop in bed with the huboons and blockheads at Disney. This should have had its head crushed a la Booji Boy.I think I'm handing in my spudboy resignation and using my energy dome for what most people think it is . . . a flowerpot.Signed,epsteinsmutha",0
249,0,"This book isn't scary, its silly","Okay, the first few chapters had a creepie feel maybe but this novel lands with a big thud halfway through. The so-called suspense attempts to build up throughout 3/4 worth of the book only to reveal a dissapointing ending that didn't have any chills whatsoever. I don't understand the high ratings this book has recieved. If you want a better ""cold weather"" horror novel to read, try After Sundown by Randall Boyll.",0

252,1,A riveting depiction of traditional Lapp ways via legend.,"Beautifully photographed and directed and acted, even when many of the actors are amaturs. Violent, but only to show the reality of survival in those times. Ancient customs, fighting for survival, and coming of age all done with fine legendary flavor. A tale worth retelling for the past 1000 years and for the next thousand also.",1
253,1,The original,"A great book and even more remarkable that it was written 27 years ago. Of course common people can't play like the pro's.

Don't even bother reading these books until #32 these are like a different series. I don't know excactly what's happing but these new authors suck!,0
256,0,"Fantastic concept, very poor execution of it","As a couple who is really into apocalyptic fiction, we were looking forward to checking this series out. We've watched three episodes now and it's painful to watch. It's like they pulled all the characters from the pages of an Abercrombie & Fitch catalog and it's so unbelievable when watching. Everyone looks like a model and the women are all hanging out. Everyone is way too clean for what they'd be in the situation they are in. On top of that, the acting isn't good.",0
257,0,Diluted prose,"This book was my introduction to Tom Robbins, and it left me unsatisfied. It seemed to me that he attempted to advance the story (and his philosophizing) by throwing images and similes at the reader, and hoping some stuck. The result is frustrating -- Switters is a tedious travel companion who talks too much and says too little, and descriptions that fail to resonate at first (""too damn vivid"", ""fierce, hypnotic green eyes"") do no better when repeated. Don't take Pynchon's praise too seriously; ""Fierce Invalids"" lacks the intensity, depth, and humor that ""Gravity's Rainbow"" achieves.",0
258,1,Great buy!!!,I am so happy with this high chair. It is great for sitting on the floor for a snack or securing to a dinning room chair for dinne. It is very simple to use and store easily. It is so affordable and easy to clean you would be silly to buy anything else! I love it !,1
259,1,"yes, you can love your coffee maker ...","in case you're wondering, it's possible for a coffee maker to make coffee as tasty as from a filter and cone system. (That's probably because this maker uses a filter and cone inside). Great product, great price.",1

He had been having difficulty getting up and once up, he was dragging his leg. After using this product for 2-3 weeks, I began to notice improvement. Now he is back to running around in the yard and chasing cats and squirrels. He is obviously feeling much better. Before I found Joint Rescue, I tried 2 prescriptions medications and one supplement from the vet. This product has worked better for my dog than any of the other pills that I tried.",0

Richard Hefner from West Virginia was one of the original members of this band who started playing around 1968. The Black Mountain Bluegrass Boys have continued to play traditional bluegrass in the traditional way with non-electric instruments. This is one of the best traditional bluegrass bands around today. You won't be disappointed with this CD. Then you will want more of their music. If you haven't heard the Black Mountain Bluegrass Boys before then you are missing out. Great musicians, great vocals, good drive. You can't beat it. Hope you will be able to catch a concert sometime. You won't be disappointed.",1

""Up above, what wind-walks! what lovely behaviour/Of silk-sack clouds! has wilder, wilful-wavier/Meal-drift moulded ever and melted across skies? ..."" This is missing, but there is still enough (and but the beholder wanting). I wish, also, there were more high school English teachers who are excited, passionate about the great poets, but they've become mired in the cult of relevancy. Such a loss. Such a loss.",0

I bought 9 bottles and solely used them for about 2 weeks, with no improvement. There is nothing wrong with the bottles themselves, but they are time consuming to clean so I discontinued use. Also, I thought later on I might just use them as regular bottles, however they leak if they do not have the ventilation system in them.",0
278,1,A favorite bedtime story,"This was a favorite as soon as we added this to our 2yo son's library. The writing is clever and the rhythm is perfect. The illustrations are beautiful, and completely engaging. This book could not be better. It's the greatest picture book we own.",1
279,0,Not very good,"First of all, the method opening the chamber to install the batteries seems simple on paper. Actually opening the chamber takes up too much time and effort. Then putting the cover back on is another hassle in itself. I enjoyed the small size, though, but that small satisfaction is overshadowed by the frustration by trying to open the chamber. I do not recommend this because I am sure that people can find other mice that are not only small and compact, but are easier to use.",0
280,1,Beware of Spoilers in the Stump Translation!!!,"This book is fabulous, I highly recommend it, especially the Jordan Stump translation.

You may also want to skip the summary at the beginning of each chapter.",1

282,0,Not for us,"My family loves eating curries, that is why I was surprised at how much we didn't like this one. It reminded me of a badly seasoned spaghetti sauce. Loaded with tomato sauce and not much else. It was edible, but not very enjoyable for us. We have tried other sauces made by this company and liked them, so I cannot say that the brand is totally bad. I prefer the spice pastes though because I can work with them more.",0

286,0,RAUNCHY,"This show has its funny moments (not as many as the American version) but it is flat-out raunchy. And by raunchy, I mean: vulgar, smutty, crude, earthy, obscene and hands-down dirty. Almost every single joke is based on sexual situations or a part of the human body.If you have any standards at all, leave this one alone and try the american version, much cleaner and much funnier.Too many ""breakfast beans"" in this piece of TV crud. It's like eating a sandwich with a big beatle inside of it. There's some good to it, but you have to eat trash to get to it.",0
287,0,Wireless Headphone,Maybe I just don't understand this wireless system. My husband and I purchased these because he watches TV in bed. He is hard of hearing and turns the volume up to the point it keeps me awake.But with this wireless headset we thought you would not have to hear the volume on the TV at all. Well that's not true. It says turn the source of the volume up instead of the headset so there is no hissing. Well you can still hear the hissing and the TV volume is still turned up loud.We adjusted the base and he is not far from it. He still has to have the volume on the TV turned up. I thought it was just him so I tried them and I had the same problem. TV had to be turned up loud and static was unbearable for my ears.SO WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THE WIRELESS HEADSET IF I CAN STILL HEAR THE TV?,0
288,1,Wow still a great show,Great love this show. Crazy twist and turn just always really good. Season 1 was epic but season 2 feels great and exicting from the killer with mother issues. Too the nun that has the devil in her.,1

292,1,Another gem from darden smith.....,"I bought this cd in the fall when it was released in Englandand have been playing this on heavy rotation in the Cd playersince. It has so many great songs and his focus on world issuesand love and loss always find there way into your head, greatsinging, the band is exceptional this time out, everything about""Field of Crows"" is classy, its Darden's mature, smooth vocalsand laid back approach to recording that makes his musicstand out, especially on this one. He writes songs so well, ""Mary"" for instance hasa different perspective on a father trying to explain andbe supportive to his little girl whose mother is about to marryanother man. The title cut is one of my favorites, justso filled with atmosphere. Taking in so many classics fromthe 70's from Neil Young and Jackson Browne to name a few, Darden has gone back and written a patch of songs that onecan listen to over and over through the years, another winnerin his 10+ collection.",1

296,0,Not as described. False advertising.,As a product it is fine and works as stated. My issue is that the description leads you to believe that both wings are included when in fact only 1 side is included. If you want both then you'll have to buy two. This is very misleading and is false advertising in my opinion. The description needs to be updated to reflect that only a single side is included.,1

Yet, about the same cost. Lacks settings and flexibility in firmware. On a positive note, it can be used as a client bridge.Speed wise, wireless repeating is about unrealized even w/ dd-wrt.

301,1,Better as romance than slapstick,"The Bottom Line:A serious film that's marred by some underwhelming scenes of slapstick (though to be honest the boxing scene is really pretty well done), City Lights deserve to be remembered for the wonderfully sweet scenes between the blind woman and the tramp, not the crazy hijinks that ensue for the other half of the film.3/4",1

303,1,quite a bit different from the movie,"While I in no way defend what Betty did, the movie version had Dan and Linda as angels just picked on by Betty. In the book, it showed the way Dan really manipulated the system and got what he wanted. They knew she was crazy but I don't think she would have went over the deep end as much if Linda hadn't took over her house, kids, even the Notre Dame games, just stepped into her shoes. You see it all the time, women work so he can go to school, give up their career and when men go through their ""menopause"" they want a younger woman along with their corvette. This is definitely a tragedy and I just wonder now how the kids lives turned out.",0

Jeremy Jordan was great in this movie and i really liked how no one trusted him or liked him in the beginning but because of him the chorus does great. i recommend the movie to everyone,1
310,1,Best buy,I have used this machine for about a month and find it most satisfactory.The machine takes your blood pressure 3 times and does an average.

This book was a big disappointment that never captured even the slightest essence of Paris. If Gopnik was a painter his palette would be limited to a tiresome grey.,0
314,1,a very good read,I think that everyone who has been touched by the autism spectrum should read this book. It really opens up your eyes as to what is really going on with your loved one. I also like how she related it back to her life. The only thing that bothered me is that I felt that she put herself above others on the Autism Spectrum... When I say that I mean that she believes that she has gone further in her life than others on the spectrum will ever go. Who is she to put a limit on what others can achieve?,1

317,0,Out-of-date,"The book is definitely out-of-date, having been published in 1996. I bought this one, looked at it a bit and returned it. Ended up buying the Black and Decker book instead (published 2004).",0
318,1,Oustanding book,"The book,"" Memoirs of a Giesha"" is an extremely good book. The story takes you to the streets of Gion Japan,where you are thrust in to a different culture. The book gives vivid detail to the surroundings and pinpoints true facts on the Geisha's lifestyle. The book may be fiction, but as you read it becomes real. ""Memoirs"" is an outstanding book.I recommend this book to anyone who is open to learning about different cultures.",1
319,1,An excellent resource!,"This is an excellent resource for those who want to learn the language of the Icelanders. I am very impressed at the tight relationship between the book and the CD's. Lessons on the CD follow exactly those in the book.After only using this course for a month, I already have a greater understanding of the cases of words (nominative, accusative, dative and genitive) than I ever had in 3 years of studying German. The course materials naturally flow from basic conversation (What is your name? My name is....) into more and more complex sentences, and explain in-depth the case changes as they become relevant.If I had one recommendation for this course, I would suggest more time within the CD lessons to repeat what has been said in Icelandic. There is very little space given to practice saying the words on your own, and you may find you need to manually pause the CD in order to say the words. Since the CD lessons are conversational, this can become frustrating over time.",1
320,0,Wasted idea,"This animated movie could have been all the good things that other reviews talk about. Instead, it's a boring tear-jerker, a 90-minute or so wasted idea.",0
321,0,"Truly, Stunningly Horrible!","I heard this Rach 2 on public radio today, and was awestruck. I waited for twenty minutes in my driveway to hear who could possibly posses this clumsy sense of rhythm, this ability to make even the most graceful transitions sound forced, this manor of hammering awkwardly at the most beautiful left-hand runs ever composed, and a total -- and I mean complete and utter -- lack of dramatic sensibility. The local NPR station sometimes plays recordings of the local community orchestra; perhaps the no-name soloist from last season?... No, I would have remembered a performance as bad as this...Of course I recognized the name of Kissin when I heard it, famous as it is. However, I am not familiar with the rest of his discography for a simple reason; I only buy discs which are acclaimed critically. Yet, modest as Kissin's reputation is among reviewers, this performance truly shocked me. It really was THAT bad.",0
322,0,consistent technical glitches rendered it unviewable,This looked like an absolutely fascinating program and I ordered it for my son's ninth birthday present--but to my (and his) dismay when we started to watch it the DVD froze and jumped to the point that the program was unwatchable. I returned it for a replacement from Amazon--and had the same problem with the replacement. We watched another video immediately afterwards so I'm sure the problem was not with my DVD player. Too bad...it looks fascinating but they need to check their quality control.,0
323,1,I used to be addicted to this show,"I was never really interested in this show's overall plot (it didn't seem like the writers were either), but what I liked about it was the characters. You had two groups of people: The super-serious scientist types who were always making decisions for everyone, and the cool people who would more or less ignore thier decisions and do whatever they felt like. This usually led to serious consequences, and that was the plot of most episodes. I always liked the cool folks, even though they continually screwed everything up. They were really human characters and really sympathetic. They weren't cardboard cutouts of ""good"" people like Star Trek, and that was the best thing about the show.I'm glad it's finally coming out on DVD. I'll definitely pick it up. I miss those folks!",1

325,0,Don't waste your money,I bought this for my 10 year old son for Christmas since it was the number one thing he wanted. It was a piece of junk. It was cheap plastic and had to be set up in an very precise configuration to work at all. It is overly sensitive. Even with his very good hand/eye coordination he couldn't make it work with his games at all. Things were bouncing all over the screen. He asked me to take it back.,0

327,1,Fantastic CGI with a solid story = one of Disney's best,"This is an excellent movie, especially for those who love dinos. Although as in every Disney movie there are discrepancies with reality, this movie is awesome in its attempt to recreate the times and surroundings for these monsters. I also like the way Disney attempted to explain the destruction of the dinos by ridding us of that ""all at once"" theory that describes the extinction as immediate. Just a wonderful movie that everyone will love.....If you take your child to see a Disney movie and attempt to entwine Darwin ... well maybe you need to stay home more often.",1
328,1,Great documentary!,"This is a really interesting film. It gives you an inside look at the dark and gritty aspects of political campaigning in America. I think the best part about it was being able to see the inner workings of Vigilante's campaign team, up close and personal. The banter between Vigilante and Kennedy is great too. Even though the movie deals with an important and serious issue, it manages to be funny too. I'd highly recommend it!",1
329,1,Profound,"I bought this CD blindly - just because I needed something to listen to, and I am amazed. One word descibes this CD: Profound! It definitely strays away from Sasha's normal groove, and I hope he can keep this up. This is a beautiful CD.",1
330,0,Horrible,"I had taken Mandarin in the past, studied it on my own though various resources, so I wasn't flying in blind. Mainly, I've used the primary 2 texts. I don't understand why this is now a text, which was the text for my last college class. The video content (if you can get it), is actually decent, but it just cannot justify how horrible this text is. I've actually decided to opt out of Mandarin studies at my current school, because I just think this text is that abominable. I'm going to study privately.",0

333,1,"Beautiful album of Gaelic music! Fantastic singer, great songs!","Christine Primrose is a singer from the Isle of Lewis in the Hebrides of Scotland. When I first heard this CD, I was hooked! Get any of her CDs and enjoy some of the finest vocal music you will ever hear! This one, however, is my favorite. Some tracks are a cappella but some of the finest musicians in Scotland back her on other tracks. One of those musicians is Alison Kinnaird, premier Scottish harper and often Christine's performing partner. Their album ""The Quiet Tradition"" is beautiful also. Their musicianship and their rapport are wonderful to listen to!The Quiet TraditionThe easy way to choose among Christine's CDs is of course just to go ahead and buy one (or more) of each.",1

335,1,great book,this is a great book!I agree that there are better methods for training a dog. but that is not what this book is about.

337,1,"Finally acquiring a copy of ""A Distant Trumpet""","This movie was filmed in the Gallup, New Mexico area back in the early 1960's. It was really a low budget, and poor rendition of Paul Horgan's book by the same name. As a result, it never became popular, or ""classic"" enough to be offered through video catalogs.Since I am one of the cavalrymen, I have always wanted to get a copy of the film. For years, everywhere I tried to find a copy, either video or DVD, I was unsuccessful.That is until Amazon.com is now providing copies of films through its Archive Collection.This is a wonderful new service, and I hope collectors of old movies take full advantage of it!Also, it took only a week, or so, for delivery of my order, and I can, after all these years, watch myself charging over the hills against the Apaches!Martin Link",0

348,1,Tough to beat . . . Hard to break,"I actually was given this knife from a friend. It was run over a few times due to being dropped in the middle of an intersection, but aside from a few deep scratches and wear on one of the thumb nubs it works like new.It has kept a very sharp edge after lots of use and has yet to give me a reason to replace it.The only cons it has are with its shape/size. It is not very natural feeling in the hand and also is so small that I tend to hold it w/ my hand very close to the blade which is not preferable.Overall it is a great ""small"" knife and if the size is not an issue it will more than meet your needs.4/5 stars for size, (would be 4.5 if possible)",0
349,1,Imagine being there!,What a great look back at what times were like in the life of a real cowboy. Well written. I really liked that he told stories that showed his mistakes and victories. I have shared these books with friends. All really enjoyed them as much as I did.,1

352,1,Great History of the Middle East,Mrs Albright has a strong grasp of Middle Eastern history as well as Islam. A good quick read by a very moderate voice.,1
353,0,Boring,"This is a tedious novel. It's only 180 pages long and I still had to push myself to bother finishing it. This is really nothing more than a short story padded out to short novel length and that's one of its many problems: The central mystery is uninteresting. The way it is written, 2 old men telling the story to a young woman, allows for no real action or confrontation. The 2 old men telling the story are irritating and long-winded, having much difficulty coming to a point, there is no resolution at the end and no point in the story being told. This is not a 'hard-boiled' crime novel as the cover suggests.I'm not really sure what this book is besides dull. Stephen king is a wonderful writer and it's enticing to see him try a new genre, but if anyone else had written The Colorado Kid, it would not have been published in this series.",0

355,0,No plot,The story plot of this movie sucked. It started going on a boat trip it ended going back on the same boat trip. She was in this time still world that she kept re-livin. The question is WHY. The movie did not give a reason. What happened to make her go into this state. It started in the time still state and ended the same way. I will never watch this movie again. I gave it one star because that is lowest grade I can go.,0
356,0,Not Worth the Price,"Be wary of this release! Ostensibly a special, it is a poorly strung together compendium of movie trailers!

And no, they are not odorless! You will definitely get a whiff of garlic when you belch, and I tend to do that a lot immediately after taking one. They are a bit pricey, which is okay since it comes with 500 capsules. You only need to take one a day so this will last me for over a year. I just hope it doesn't loose its potency during that time.",1

They are good buy if your not too worried about quality. But don't pay anymore than $100 for the set, they usually only cost $25 - $50. There are some buyers selling them for around $90.",0

The prestige classes here really focus more on giving divine focus to other classes.

368,1,DId what I expected,"All in all, this product did what I wanted it to do: smoothed out my hair and cut back on styling time. I have very very thick long hair, it is not super curly but I have a nice natural wave. This product did NOT eliminate my wave, it only took out a little of my natural curl. I also have colored hair and it didn't affect my color (dark brown with red highlights and low lights). It cut back on styling time immensely for me which is why I really like it. When I now blow-dry/ flat iron my hair it's sleeker, shiner, and less wavy. After flat-ironing my hair it now straightens much easier and feels amazingly soft, less heavy, and keeps it's style. The only bad thing about this product is the time it takes to process. The entire process took me 4 hours and I could not stand keeping the product in my hair for 48 hours so I washed it out after 24 hours. This may have affected my results a bit, but I am still pleased with my results for the price.",1

370,1,Wonderful! King's Best!,"I was really reluctant to read Bag of Bones because I heard so much bad reviews. I made myself read it and I loved it! I've read it twice now!From the first page, I was hooked. King just took my emotions and ran with them. He put the drama in mixed with the horror. Yeah. . . there was lack of action and ghost ect. which King usually writes but look at this in another view. I am a huge fan of King and this is definately my favorite.It was also very freaky. Of course he had ghosts. . . then it really wouldn't be a knig novel. And let me tell you them ghosts are so freaky. It literally sent chills up my spine!So if your looking for a novel that will make you sad, make you smile, and make you scared to death, then I would completely recommend this book to you!!!",1
371,0,Not One Of The Best Comics I've Seen.,"I don't think Get Fuzzy is about politics and history. The problem some have is that a lot of people compare it to the very best comics i.e. Bloom County. That is the problem. It isn't that it is not about politics, religion, history etc, the point is is that the great comics used these themes in their work (and not just one or twice mentioning Ceasar). That is why it should not be compared to the best comics. It isn't about op-eds it is about how completly less than average this strip is, save the drawings. Also Conley is not the master of subtleties, as some people claim. What if I were to wear a rugby shirt for my class picture, does that make me a master of subleties? NO! Mentioning The Hobbit in the story line does not include him to be the master of subtle humor either. The creators of the Simpsons, an example, really know how to use subtle humor--they mastered it. Conley needs to get some really great assistants to help him out.",0
372,0,OVERRATED! IT'S JUST AN OK ALBUM,"I Voted for him during the Australian Idol! But this album disappointed me and now I really think Paulini should have crowned the Australian Idol. I think he done better on the competition than this album. It's just an ok album but not a bad album. Basically it is still acceptable. I rated this album a 2 stars material because some of the songs really got me bore. Hope the next album would be a better album.Frankly speaking, I think the other Australian Idol Season 1's finalist whose named Rob Mills(a.k.a known as Millsy or Millswah) has a better album ""Up All Night"" produced compare to this one. Also keep an eye out for Paulini Curuenavuli's album ""One Determind Heart"" and Cosima De Vito's forthcoming album(currently the album is on working in US with music producer Diane Warren), they will be an even better albums for sure. Check them out guys ;>",1

I read the blog about this book and assumed it would be light, funny and a good mystery. Wrong on all counts! The characters are not developed, the book doesn't have one funny line in the whole thing and the murders are beyond grisly!

375,1,Rock And Roll!,"The production on this third effort by Toto is less intense that on the others, but this album is nonetheless a highly undrerrated record. There were no hits from this album, but it nonetheless has 8 great songs. Indeed, there is the distorted guitar riff in ""I Think I Could Stand You Forever"" which is just slightly reminiscent of grunge rock (ten years later), and ""English Eyes"" truly is a fascinating song. ""If It's the Last Night"" is a nice ballad that should have been a hit single. Overall, a very good album.",1
376,0,Much smaller than expected,"The quality seems okay, but the size that came is much smaller than expected.

380,0,Black & White Rose,This new Synergy release turned out to be a tru disappointment. Clearly advertised as Roy's First Trucolor this ain't it. It's a lousy B&W print of Apache Rose with Roy at the top of his game in 1947. We know some Republic Trucolors survived the 40's and 50's and some did not. When I saw this new release with the Trucolor cover I got excited that possibly they found a good print to release in color for the first time. But no. The specs were no help as they didn't indicate b&w or color. The only positive thing I can say is the run time is the fully uncut 75 minutes.,0

Worked great UNTIL the digital ""improvement"". Then we lost any of the channels that were broadcasting on the UHF frequencies. I put up this antenna aimed it and voila!, we had our missing channels. Dang! It provides excellent reception on transmitters providing better then minimal power and does quite well even on the minimal power ones but those will fade in and out at times. Oh I forgot to say, we live around 70 miles away from the transmitters as the crow flies. Plan on some time to assemble.",0

387,0,Save Your Money,"I wish I would have taken to heart the reviewers who said it wasn't worth the money...it is a flimsy product--the track won't stay together. The ""start"" button got stuck and would no longer launch the cars which meant the cars couldn't ride through the loop. Also, the elevator stopped working properly as well.My 5 year old son loved the toy...my 3-1/2 year old daughter not so much (because it kept falling apart).I'm mad that I wasted my money and will have to go through the hassle of sending it back!",0
388,0,If Only Moore Would Have Produced A Documentary,"That this film is still being called a ""documentary"" is a slap in the face of those who produce documentaries. Moore has very artfully packaged political commentary and sold it as ""truth"". If you Google around the web, you'll find many examples of how Moore massaged his message and staged this flick to conform to his beliefs.If you think this film is ""truthful"" you must also believe Stone's ""JFK"" is factually correct.",1
389,1,Fast and easy!,"Love this book! I tried the easiest ball and it only took me about 2 hours to complete. I stitched it by hand. Fun and addicting!

393,1,Mort Fega introduced me - - -,"- - to Bob Dorough's work when we were both jazz DJs in Phoenix on KXIV in the early 70's. By the way, we had better numbers on our low powered AM station than the Stereo-FM/NPR affiliate. As I recall, Mort produced the album, and I loved it from the first. His piano's okay, the guitarist gets over-his-head a time or two, but the whole album (as the aforementioned reviews illustrate) was a joy! One of my ex-wives had the vinyl copy, so I'm now rewarding myself with the CD, thank you.And, yes, Bob was doing those Saturday Morning Cartoons some years ago...Hey, Life Is Good!",1
394,0,What Went Wrong,"At least the original ran for an entire season. This ""reimaging"" lasted six episodes before ABC pulled the plug and took it off life support. Despite the participation of people from the X-Files and the original Night Stalker. What they forgot was the sense of fun of the original and turned it into something darker than Millenium! (Hard to imagine.) Carl Kolchak is a bumbling reporter trying to get back to the bigtime who continually encounters stories that no one can believe. In the new version he is not rumpled Darren McGavin but a rather more urbane Stuart Townsend. Driven by the mysterious death of his family he is on a quest to uncover the truth. (His companion is obnxious). For completists.",0
395,0,Disappointment in the making,"To be honest, I bought this book for my brother in law and was really excited about it because he is a die hard duck hunter. He goes to Alaska for special trips at least once a year, and otherwise spends many hours perfecting his duck call and training his dog. But to be honest, the book was a disappointment. The writing accompanying the photos was mediocre at best. Disjointed and forced, the photos at least tried to create a story. But even the photos were not as entertaining as the review would lead you to believe. This book really deserves only two stars. It does look like a nice coffee table book, but after paging through the first few pages, I don't foresee many dying to finish it.",0

398,0,"Be suspicious, be very suspicious","Since the publication of the memoir by Time magazine's Robert Blair Kaiser (""Clerical Error"", Continuum International Publishing Group, 2002) we know that Malachi Martin was a seriously twisted individual who became extremely adept at creating false realities. This is putting it mildly: he didn't just tell a few lies, he lived many lies for many years (read Kaiser's book for details on this and more).So any claims made by Martin in his supposedly ""factual"" writings (to which this exorcism volume belongs) cannot be believed unless there is some independent verification. None exists in relation to this book, for reasons which will be obvious to anyone who wastes time (as I did) on this nonsense.If you like ghost stories, and understand that nothing in this book is likely to be true, I suppose you might get a thrill from it. Otherwise forget it.",0

406,0,"Worst excuse for a ""reference"" book I've ever come across","Five years later, and nothing's changed - this book is still an embarrassment and Facts on File will never own up to it.I need not cite any other example than this one: The entry on the pioneering program ""Amos 'n' Andy"" runs for several pages - and through the entire piece, Lackmann confuses Charles Correll, who played Andy, with Freeman Gosden, who played Amos, persistently having it the other way round. If he cannot even get this elemental fact about the show straight, there is no reason to pay attention to any other assertion he might make. It's inexcusable.As others note, errors like this may be found on every single page. What a waste of paper.Readers interested in old-time radio are directed to the very excellent ""On the Air: the Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio,"" by John Dunning.",0
407,0,One of the worst comercials (I mean movies) ever!!!,"This movie (with Jurassic Park 2 and Demolition Man) is at the top of my list of worst movies ever. You got to love Tom Hanks, but this movie is stupid, stupid, stupid. The whole concept is inane. You are constantly bombared by product placement. You won't even like the characters. This was my conclusion just 20 minutes into the movie. I watched another 10 minutes before giving up. Stay away from this one!",0
408,1,Great workout,"I just finished working out with a personal trainer with an expensive price tag for 8 weeks. I have LOTS of DVD workouts, including Cathe. I decided to get this DVD because I like Cindy as an instructor (she is on Barry's Bootcamp, which I have; love her, he's annoying). I can get VERY annoyed by instructors and then I don't want to use the DVD. Cindy is not annoying in any way. I think she gives very good cues, it's not hard to follow her, and I got a good workout, too. The best part: The price tag and it's quick. Don't know if I'll lose weight (I've just done each workout once), but that really depends on whether I control my eating (a diet plan is included). As far as how she looks, come on guys. Aren't we here to critique the DVD? Many women would kill for Cindy's body!",1
409,0,WARNING - False Advertisement,"This is a horrible movie with no plot. Worse, there is no nudity. This product is not advertised as the next ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Citizen Cain"", but it is advertised as an ""R"" rated sex comedy. Further, when you press play, before the movie starts, a screen comes up that states that this movie was rated ""X"" by the BBC. What a bunch of crap. This movie could be shown on regular television. Fox could air this tripe at 1:00 p.m. on a Sunday afternoon and no one would bat an eyelash (not that anyone would actually keep the remote on this movie for very long). I really do not see how this movie could possibly appeal to anyone. The fact that Seduction Cinema actually transferred this to DVD and marketed it shows either an incredible lack of judgment or a conscious attempt to defraud its customers.",0
410,0,my stupidity,"OK, it was my fault for not even knowing that you can't play European DVDs on USA players, and yes, it does state quite clearly when ordering that it was for ""Zone 2"", but I wish I had been protected from my own stupidity by a more dire warning label.The company, when contacted, did offer a refund, but I must first mail it back - first class postage- to Belgium, so I'll be rueing my mistake and taking the purchase price deficit, which is less than the postage!",0

415,1,The only funny show on TV since Seinfeld,"Normally I think TV is a waste of time, and most sitcoms are boring and predictable, but THIS IS A WORK OF ART!

416,1,Cool,"I really liked this helmet, it looks realistic and it is a full helmet (not a mask) so that is awesome, it looks great in pictures! But it is very uncomfortable to wear for a long time, it is very difficult to see while wearing it (and I can't wear it with my glasses).So if you're planning to wear it for a halloween costume I am not sure if that is a good idea since I can't wear it for longer than 15min without having to take it off and breath.

I double checked it and there was still notthing red there, there wasn't even a infuser. Now I'm wondering what does ""the grinder is pre setup with real coffee"" mean, as explaned in the manual.

Although I enjoyed the history of medicine, I would have given this book 5 stars if it were more concise and lead into influenza and pandemic details more quickly.I was fascinated by the authors theory of President Wilson's neurologic sequelae potentially causing his lapses in judgment that may have had profound effects on our future. I was also amazed by the power and control that the U.S. government garnered during WW I. It was also interesting to find the true source of the pandemic to be in a small town in the U.S.With the current swine flu pandemic underway, I am hopeful that if/when the next wave hits it will not be as lethal as the 1918 strain and that a effective vaccine will be available soon.",1

The only song I actually liked was the ""B**ch"" song and that was only because the beat was so cold. I hated the words. I love to watch D12 on t.v. Their personalities make them interesting, but on a song, the only people I'm trying to listen to are Proof and Eminem. Everybody else sounds the same besides Bizarre, and that dude is just annoying. At first, I used to be like ""Okay, that was funny but weird"" and now I'm like ""Umm...you haven't grown out of the attention-getting, huh?"" And Proof said he calls his mother a b**ch so now I'm really annoyed. I just recently started liking Eminem after the ""Mosh"" video so pretty much, this was a waste of money for me.",0

444,0,Good idea that fails in implementation,"I originally was quite interested in seeing this film after reading a lot of good press about it. When I finally did see the film theatrically I mainly saw little more than the failed possibilities.In my opinion the greatest weakness is in focus. The two founders are not particularly interesting characters and the choice to focus on them to the exclusion of the company itself brought the film down. As well there are significant time gaps in the growth of govWorks.com while other sections (most notably the rather boring part about securing venture capital) are given a disproportionate share of the time. In the end I never was able to care about the characters or gain any real feeling for the company they founded. It could have been about any other business that failed with very little that was specific to the time, place, or culture that surrounded the Dot-Com Boom and why it went bust.",0

I thought this book was titled ""HOW TO DESIGN AND BUILD TRAILERS"". The book has good information so far, but all through the book it tells you there is more information on this in another book.

458,0,Not as funny as I expected,This movie fails on many levels to deliver on what I expected to be a much funnier outing for Wilson. The movie falls down on humor and really overall quality. Don't get me wrong - there are some funny moments but they are few and further between than I would have liked. I didn't like the characters enough to care what happened to them and I didn't believe what happened to them when it did happen. The blonde is not believable and she is unlikely as the realistic sexual interest for Owen Wilson (unless he is OWEN WILSON - ACTOR and not the character in the movie).This is not a movie that I will watch again. Better than Bad Teacher - MUCH MUCH MUCH worse than Wedding Crashers (my benchmark film in this genre).,0

It's a simple plot but kept our attention throughout the movie. The informative commentary by Author Scott Eyman is interesting, something the viewers of 1935 did not get.",1

463,0,What were they thinking?,"Although the gaming industry has long needed girl games, there is no excuse for putting out a game like this in 1998. Sierra was putting out better games 15 years earlier. The puzzles are too difficult. The interface is terrible. Their more recent games are much better, but I'm still a little bothered by the fact that they don't seem to have any of the old gamers on staff that could tell them how to correctly balance a game.",0

465,0,Horrible Repair Service,"The camera is great. Small, easy to use, great lens, and fine pictures. My complaint is with Panasonic service.After a couple of years, the sensor or something went, rendering the camera useless. Following instructions, I sent the camera to their service center. Got the camera back in a few weeks. THE CAMERA WAS IN EXACTLY THE SAME INOPERABLE CONDITION AS IT WAS WHEN I SENT IT IN TO BE REPAIRED. I phoned them, and was unable to speak with anyone responsible. Finally I received a return sticker. Returned the camera. I just got a new bill charging me for another repair on the same camera for the same money I paid in the first place. It is impossible to speak to anyone on the phone who can resolve a problem. I sent copies of all documents back to them and now await some kind of reply. DO NOT BUY PANASONIC IF YOU EXPECT ANY CUSTOMER SERVICE REGARDING REPAIRS.",0
466,0,"Will have to shoo the festering flies away, but","In order to appreciate this horrid piece of low low budget bucket o' feces, you have to watch this movie twice. After you watch it the first time, go back and watch it with the commentary on. Now it's not a movie, now it becomes an extremely funny tell all as they describe scene flubs, the back stories, etc,. The commentary deserves 5 stars as some of their comments had me in tears. As a South Park fan, I wanted to see the growth of their writing and it is obvious it has really matured. The wit had not hit here yet.",1

I bought some Scosche IDRM400m with it and only problem I have with this setup is that, if I plug in the headphones ALL the way in the sound doesn't sound as good. So I have to BARELY move them out a little for it to sound like it should. So if you have those headphones just remember that.",0
469,0,Not much to like...,"Sorry, but I found this book to be full of characters that didn't interest me in the slightest. The characters were filled out with quirkiness rather than depth, and most showed a mean streak, except Liv. I wasn't able to get a full sense of any of the characters except the preachers, who, in their fanaticism, are one-dimensional anyway. I wasn't able to care for these people who dealt with each other only on the surface, and always for their own purposes. Most were abusive to animals, neglecting to feed or water the animals that were their supposed livelihood - something only trash farmers would do. To say nothing of dumping dogs, putting a cat in a dishwasher, and leaving a bull to drown in mud.Hungry for something in common, acceptance, and a purpose missing from each of their dull lives, most cling to the church, faking their way through the expected rituals. These characters didn't stay with me when I closed the book, and neither did the story.",0
470,1,Bravo Josh Gracin!,"It took me some time to grab a hold of Josh Gracin's debut album but I'm very glad I did. This is one of the rare albums that I've had the chance to listen to that I actually really enjoyed from cover to cover over the past year or so. This album contains some very solid tracks, at least half of them are good enough to be released as singles. Majority of the songs Josh picked out shows off how much talent he posseses (he should have come in second to Kelly Clarkson in the first American Idol!). Though most cuts are strong, as mentioned, some stand out from the rest including the ones he released (and eventually became hits) ""Stay With Me"", ""I Want To Live"", ""Nothing to Lose"", and then there's the very moving ""The Other Little Soldier"".",1

476,1,Replacement for Recalled Black & Decker,"I researched many insulated carafe coffeemakers after having mine recalled by manufacturer with no similar replacement. This one was given much praise. I must agree with the recommendations and I recommend this one also. It keeps the coffee hot several hours after preheating the pot with hot water. I have not used the timer but the clock is easy to see with it's blue lit glow. The top to the carafe is easier to clean than my previous one and the cap also drains completely as my previous one retained some liquid in it. After owning it for a while the bottoms fall off carafe. I got a new one from manufacturer but the same thing happened. SOLUTION; Put base in HOT oven and carafe in freezer, after heated, put top quickly top on base (USING PROTECTED SURFACE).",1
477,1,You've done yourself proud girl !!,"Give the girl a break - I am really enjoying listening to this CD!I don't think we necessarily saw the best of Katharine on 'Idol'. These songs are varied and I love the vocals and production that have gone into each track. My favs include: 'Love Story', 'Home', 'Not Ur Girl', the brilliant 'Better Off Alone' and the single 'Over It', that is deserving of a lot more radio airplay. Just judge the CD on its own merits. Forget comparisons with other 'Idols' and the likes of Mariah or Christina. I had expected an enjoyable CD of grandma's favs! But instead I received an album displaying a modern vibe, variation and some damn fine tunes. A risk taken and career longevity ensured in the process!!",1
478,0,FAILURE OF PRODUCT,My EDGE external hard drive failed. The cause was never quite delineated by the EDGE people other than to say that the hard drive had failed. They offered only to replace the hard drive at my cost; no reimbursement for data recovery. Plus I paid for shipping and handling for the return. Evidently they feel that failure rates for products more than 2-3 years old are acceptable. Mine was maybe 3 years old at the most;very light use.BE WARNED OF A FAILURE POSSIBILITY AND SHORT LIFE SPAN FOR PRODUCT.,0

488,1,More like the movie,When I first saw the movie I hadn't read the book then after I did and watched the movie again I was appalled on how they're so different. It was like the writers for the movie only read the summary on the back of the book. But things in Volume IV make things closer to the movie. Micheal and Mia are together and Micheal is starting a band cause his webzine doesn't have any sponsers. There also stuff about an unauthorized TV movie about Mia and it is said to not include Tina Hankinbama just like the real movie.,0

490,1,"Beautiful dress, had to resize it","The dress was lovely, though the sizing runs on the large side. Most of my daughter's wardrobe is 24 mos/2T, but the 2T was very large on her and we had to have it altered for the wedding she was to wear the dress for. If you look at the sizing chart, it tells you the exact measurments of each size and I knew it would be big before purchasing it, but that is the dress the bride wanted, so we bought it anyway. One problem we had was that my daughter kept pulling the flowers off the front of it! They are hot-glued to the clasps that hold them onto the dress, so we ended up sewing them onto the clasps which worked fine. The dress arrived on time and was well packed and I would purchase from this vendor again, no problem. I gave it 4 stars because of the hot glue attachment on the clasps...sewing would have been better.",1
491,0,"""A heart made out of sand and s*** ""","I didn't come up with that line, it was from the movie. The best line from the movie, in my opinion, as a beleaguered school principal finally cuts loose and tells a clueless couple that their horrid, heinous child really does need some major help. That line perfectly sums up this really awful film, peopled with some of the most unappealing characters I've seen lately. Shame on the folks responsible, for exploiting the tragedy of 9/11 by using it to showcase this bunch of freaks. Even the wonderful Tony Shalhoub merely played ""Mr. Monk becomes a Therapist.""

494,1,Buu's Fury,"I had heard about this game and wanted to try it out. I finally found one on Amazon and thought it was pretty awesome!Pros:I felt that it was longer than Legacy of Goku 2 because of the side missions and boss battles, but I liked it better than LG2. It made a great Christmas present for my brother who took a quick liking to it. The level up process is quicker and easier than LG2. Both of us have beaten it and I highly recommend this game.Cons:You don't get to use Piccolo, but you get to use Videl and Hercule(but only for a short time). All you do with Hercule is walk up to Buu's house and you're done with him. You fight Spopovich with Videl and that's it. Some of the side missions were pointless, but it added depth to the game. Other than that, not much bad about it.",1
495,0,Yikes - this looks daunting!,"As a beginning learner, I expected this book to be a bit more structured vs diving right into complex sentences and phrases.For me personally, this book would have been more helpful to focus on everyday usage in the office place, as opposed to focusing on a specfic business situation (financial turnaround).For intermediate speakers already accustomed to the language, you may find this book useful. If you are just starting, look for something else to give you grounding before taking this book on.

497,1,Worked pretty well,"We bought the grill to take with us on vacation earlier in the summer. It has a nice, easy to transport set-up, with folding legs that seem like they will be rickety, but turn out to be pretty stable. Putting the grill together the first time took about a half an hour.Overall, the food came out well when using this grill and it was compact and easy to handle. The only complaints are that it is is hard to tell that the fire has ignited when first turning it on (I was always worried that the gas was just coming out and creating a hazard, and it is hard to see through the little viewer hole made for that purpose) and that it did not ever get quite as hot as I would have thought, increasing the cooking time and changing cooking strategies. Otherwise, no other complaints. We'll see how well it holds up to multiple uses.",1
498,1,Exceptional Book,"""Mindset of a Martial Artist"" by Dean Clerc is an exceptional book. This book does not contain anything truly new, but what it does contain is a good healthy dose of common sense, something that is not always that common in the martial arts community.The book accurately describes the problems of narrow minded training techniques and offers practical solutions to them, it includes training drills that can be implimented by martial art practitioners of any style to deal with these very problems while offering an insight into the personal philosophies of the author.The book is clearly written and presented with excellent graphics, it is easy to read and in my opinion would be an important part of any martial artist's library particularly instructors wanting the best for the students.Wayne Hanley (Shihan)Kokoro Ryu BujutsuAustralia",1

One of my friends regrets her pocket PC purchase for this reason.

But you do get seven pages on how she manages to sort out her computer problems.

I understand that they had a budget and were restricted by time, but I am just saying that they should have either waited to raise more money for the movie or they should have never made it in the first place.

Through a chance discovery she decides she wants to be a do-gooder and to make other people happy. But she is also very introverted when it comes to her own happiness. The end of the film is very moving for Amelie realises that making others happy, while gratifying, is not sufficiently fulfilling when she herself has no love in her life.As for DVD extras, the director's commentary is as charming as the movie itself - he is great company and so French with it.

533,0,Do not waste your money!!!!,"I wish I could return this game. But Target would not take it back since its opened. It doesnt read your movements. (especially the arm curls) I did not break a sweat. The resistance band is extremely weak and the biggest complaint is the wait time between exercises. You never get your heart rate going.If you ""work out"" for 3 minutes and then stand there for 2 minutes waiting for the next exercise and the explanation you are never going to get anything from it.I really wish i could return this game. Such a waste. At least the Wii fit has cutesy games you can play. This is just a sham.",0
534,1,"DDT case study a ""fraud""","It's been several years since I've read ""Silent Spring,"" one of the most significant environmental books ever written, but I must respond to the posting by ""seem,"" which is titled ""murderous, over the top propaganda"" (I correctly your misspelling of the last word): His recommendation to read ""DDT: A Case Study in Scientific Fraud"" was put out by the Heartland Institute and is, in itself, a ""fraud."" The Heartland Institute is one of the most pro-chemical, pro-industry, anti-environmental and right-wing organizations around. Nothing they put out should be believed for a second.",0
535,0,This shaver sucks,"I bought one based on the good review. However, it can not shave cleanly. I have to use a Mach 3 razor after using the electronic shaver. Worse yet, the Panasonic shaver damaged my upper lip this morning.I have to write this review to give out a warning.I wish I could return it.",0
536,0,Beloved: Yeah right,"Ok, you all must be thinking I'm this all-over negative type of person. Well, this book, was VERY low on my reading list. After reading the first 40 pages, I was so lost, it wasn't even funny. Too many characters were introduced in the first few pages. I think the author could have written the story in a little bit of a lower ""key"" so-to-speak. And, as most people do, I judged not only the rest of the book, but the author herself, on the basis of her first 40 pages. First impressions last, as the saying goes. So, as my teachers would know, I express a deep dislike for the authors style of writing. But, don't let my negativity--if you may call it that--stop you from reading this book. For you, it might all tie together in a tight knot, but for me, there were too many strands to tie off, and most ended off astray.",0
537,0,Poor quality streaming--not worth your money,"I'm a prime member, and I bought the season premiere. I didn't realize that the video quality would be fuzzy and that the second part of the episode (shown on the same night) would be an additional price. On one screen, the second episode was listed as free, but when I downloaded the first part, suddenly the second part was an additional fee.If Amazon charges for video streaming, it should at least deliver a clear picture. My connection time was excellent, with all the bars, but the video stopped a few times to ""connect"" and I had to reload the page once. Apparently this is a problem with Amazon.Best consider another source or pay the HD premium price to watch. It's a bit ridiculous to pay $6 to watch one evening's episode of Mad Mad, though.",0
538,0,Very Dissapointing Mr. Lynch,"I should've known this was going to be bad when inside the DVD is an advertisement for David Lynch's own brand of coffee beans. Can we say sell-out!? I expected these short films to be awesome. Instead what we get are boring and dissapointing short films. The first film feels amateurish, the 3rd one has David making a lamp for about a half hour that is boring as hell. During the Q&A he repeats the customers questions immediately after hearing the questions and it makes him look stupid and mentally challenged. I expected a lot more out of these along the lines of the ""Short Films of David Lynch"" but this is by far the worst thing Lynch has put out on DVD. FYI- I am a huge David Lynch fan so it does not please me to give this a negative review. There are a lot of Lynch snobs who feel everything he puts out is gold and this is simply not the case. This dvd was a waste of my time and money and I would never watch it again, neither should you.",0
539,1,Great full-set of weights!,"I've owned these for a year and a half now and have really enjoyed them. With the purchase of these and the Bowflex bench, I was able to cancel my gym membership and have saved quite a bit of money in the long run.A few complaints:1) The bars are really wide, so it's not really possible to do close-grip lifts that you could do with other dumbbells. I don't think there's really a way to fix this, and isn't a huge problem, but should be mentioned.2) The bars require you to wear lifting gloves, or the grips will hurt your hands for anything more than 40lbs.Anyway, other than those two things they're exactly like you expect. They're easy to switch weights, easy to lift out of the holders, etc.",1
540,1,Nice High Chair,This is a well designed high chair from Combi. Quality is good (Except the 5 point harness which is cheap looking) and assembly instructions were clear and easy to follow. The toy on the table is very nice and attractive to our son. There are there three issues we have experienced with this product.1. Wheels don't move around easily on hardwood floor so they just skid.2. They recliner handle gets stuck once in a while.3. The seat belt's buckle is really hard to connect and release.Overall we are happy with the product but Combi can improve it.,1
541,0,Cold Sassy Tree,"I think that this was not a good book. It never interested me and was borning through out the whole book. They did not speak proper English which is very hard to understand. All the book ever focuses on is Will's family which gets boring real quick. The book also jumps in and out of the present and past. At the end it starts to pick up and gets better,but I still think this is not a good book. Personnally I think it was a waste of my time.",0

545,0,Too hard to change the battery,"I bought this product in March 2009. It was accurate and stayed put on my clothes. The problem came when the battery ran out in October 2009. The instructions for opening the case don't work. After much effort, I succeeded in getting the case open... and simultaneously broke the clip off.",0
546,0,Full of inaccuracies and stereotypes,"I was very disappointed by this book, and if I were Native American, I might even be offended by it. The book attempts to generalize too much about a very diverse group of tribes and native groups, and it conflates time so much that it isn't always clear what happened prehistorically, what happened at contact, and what is true today. Many of the comments about Native Americans play to stereotypes (scalping is implied to be universal, for instance), and there are a few details that are just plain wrong (corn and maize listed as separate foodstuffs). I suggest you look elsewhere if you want a factual and sensitive treatment of this subject.",0

550,0,Disappointing,"I read a bunch of reviews on this movie, and I was really excited about seeing it. The first 25-30 minutes were very good... quirky, funny and a little bit over the top... then it started going down hill. I understand this was a ""made for TV"" movie, so the acting is usually somewhat special, but this was REALLY bad. There was no passion... it was just flat.Overall, I was just disappointed. I am really glad I watched it before I purchased it.",0
551,1,Fabulous! Wonderful album,"I found this at a cut-out bin in the grocery store in about 1972 (remember those? They'd cut one corner of the LP album cover and mark it way down?) and bought it because I liked the cover art & name. It ended up being one of my favorite albums when I was a teenager. The song ""If it is Love"" is still a favorite of mine, and almost every title is great. I'm so glad to find this album again. There's something mesmerizing and very pleasant about their sound. The earlier album by this group is nothing like this (I don't like it), but this one is a winner! :)",1
552,1,Only in America,The story of an american mom who wanted to make a difference. This is an opportunity to see the details and understand why McCain chose Palin to be his running mate in 2008. The speakers include her foes and friends alike. See for yourself who this woman is instead of relying on comedic skits and baseless media hits to determine whether Palin's accomplishments are real.,1
553,1,Make this book even better with hand motions,"My mother gave our daughter this book was she was about 4 months old. At first she showed no interest. I am a huge fan of Eric Carle's books and was so disappointed. Yet, I continued to periodically read this book to her. It wasn't until I added the hand motion of rubbing my hands together when it said ""the little cricket rubbed his wings together. . ."" that my daughter (now 9 months) took notice of the book. Soon she was mimicking and rubbing her hands together. Of course, she loves turning to the last page and hearing the sound of the cricket. Now this book is one of her favorites.",1
554,0,BAD BAD BAD MOVIE,"I am a huge action movie fan and I have to say with out adout this is the worst movie I have ever seen. The plot is horrible,the diolog if thats what you want to call it is so bad it makes me wanna... Idont know its just bad. The acting is god afall as well. You can tell the director did music videos first cause like music videos it has no substence or direction just style.The kung fu is so horrible in this movie you can tell they are on strigs. Not even T and A can save this movie. I was in pain watching this movie dont buy it.",0
555,0,"Woah, Man!","Marked Expert Edition, the outrageous techniques demonstrated in The Joint Rolling Handbook are complex and require a bigger attention span than the average stoner has. Even not stoned, the instructions were difficult to understand. If you're looking for practical methods and easy rolling instructions this isn't the book for you. If you already know how to roll joints and have a crafty hand, maybe it is. Most of the convincingly illustrated creations like the windmill and the nose cone require multiple papers, many of which will be cut up for the gummed strip used to ""bandage"" together joints and long tubular roaches until they resemble a smokable jumble of tinker toys quite likely to end up burning a hole in your rug. Intermingled with the individual joint instructions are a few sections offering information on marijuana itself, laws, health risks, etc.",0
556,1,Not what you think but ok.,"Just finished this book, it tells a good lesson but I believe it is more meant for the child than maybe a grownup and working person.I admit this book does refresh that sense of get up and just do it feeling and the common sense that was already in you but really this book is better suited in the elementary school library.I will for sure be telling my kids this story one way or another.",1

558,1,Needs a power cord,"My daughter loves this toy. It's true the mics don't really work that well but she loves carrying it around and can play it herself easily. So far we have had only one issue. It does not turn off automatically, which means the first time your two year old leaves it on the batteries will run down. Also, it didn't come with a power cord, although you can buy your own separately and plug it in. If it came with it's own cord I would give it 5 stars. Still recommend it.",1

560,1,Lightning Turns on the Electricity,"Just listened to this for the first time and it is a real eye opener. I have loved Lightin Hopkins for years but this is the most intense effort I have come across from him. Here he is plugged in with a bass player and a drummer brave enough to try and follow Lightnin. It all works here, the slow songs, the rockers, the boogie grooves on here were years ahead of their time and some of the leads just scream on here. Lightin sings like a younger stronger man on here and his voice is clearer and much more powerful on this recording, undimmed by age, tobacco and bourbon. This is a really great window into what a Lightning Hopkins show in a gin joint in Houston must have sounded like in the mid-50's. It is a stunningly powerful recording that shows just how broad and deep this man's immense musical powers really were. Must have for blues, folk, and rock enthusiasts. This is primal and essential.",1
561,0,Very flimsy side clamps are designed to break.,"The could a good product but it has a fatal design flaw which make it a complete ripoff. The side fasteners or clamps break within a year or so. My thinking is this is their way of creating demand for new juicers. This juicer is not a sealed unit. As others have said pulp sprays out on the counter if you're not extremely careful. I'm on my third juicer from them and I will not buy another. Yes, I have repaired them before but who wants to worry about that when you pay 250 for a juicer. I paid 250 at my local health food store. I believe in giving some of my business to local stores I believe are providing good products for the community even if I can find it cheaper online.",0
562,0,Just copy Appendix B and leave the rest,"This book, as either a tutorial or as a quick reference is rather poorly written. Using the index is often an annoying experience because many helpful commands are barely mentioned outside the end appendices. This book is simply a mediocre beginner's tutorial and a Do It Yourself reference guide - after reading it you'll be able to get around the program but you'll have no idea how to script efficiently or other memory strategies which are oftentimes easy to learn and use but ignored in this book. Much of the book is an inefficient tutorial, such as the ""Profiles:"" selections and although the CD contains some useful things most of the sample movies are disturbingly poor. The book's cost is not justified.",0
563,1,"Good printer, unless you have 64-bit Vista or Linux - no drivers","This printer prints very nice, sharp pages with good color. The cost of the toner is quite reasonable if you buy it online.However, there are no drivers for Vista (although I have heard on the internet that some people have been able to get 32-bit Vista to work) or for Linux.It seems that HP has no intention of putting out drivers for this printer for Vista, which will likely limit its useful life.",0

565,0,Gramatica de la Lengua Inglesa,"I find this book quite difficult for the spanish-speaking adult student who I am working with. Any spanish-speaking person would need a high level of education in his own language to comprehend the explanations and directions. My student is perhaps educated through grade school.This would be a good book for someone who is advanced in the spanish language.There are lines for answers, but they are close together, perhaps college-ruled or closer, so the handwriting would have to be fairly small.A good point about this book is that the answers are in the back.There are 127 pages of workbook pages, then there are two appendices and the answers, and one page of an index. Total pages: 143",0
566,0,GE Answering Machine,The machine was priced right which is why I chose it. I've owned it for about a year. This answering machine is unreliable.

It is frustrating and I am going to buy another answering machine that is a different brand.,0

569,0,Dangerous product - Avoid it!,"Like another reviewer, I put these blades on my daughter's '07 Mazda 3. Like the other reviewer, the passenger side blade slipped off its mount, fouled with the drivers side blade, bent that and freaked my daughter out. Thankfully she was not driving on an interstate and could pull off to try to fix them then drive the remaining distance without using her wipers. The product has a design flaw - on inspection I could see that the pin that is supposed to latch the blade to the arm is way too small. A gentle tug is all it takes to pull the blade off the arm, and both blades were just as easy to unlatch.I am lucky my daughter is still alive. Rainex, you should be ashamed! Pull this from the market before you have a huge lawsuit on your hands!",0
570,1,Excellent way to build your Japanese vocabulary,"Contrary to what the prior poster stated, this is a supplement only, never intended for study in isolation. It's a great way to supplement your Japanese language study because most study programs are lacking in the vocabulary area and without a large vocabulary, you will not be able to hold any meaningful conversations. I have had no trouble using almost all the words I've learned through this program in everyday conversation. If you are simultaneously learning japanese grammer, you should have no problems using a verb, adjective, adverb, etc. learned through this program.",0

572,0,No way to remember a giant.,"The music is, to be kind - fair. Jimi is worth 3 stars but I have to subtract one star for Buddy Miles playing - boooooring. Where was Mitch Mitchel when you needed him? I LOVE Hendrix I own all the records and repurchased the music on cd later. I was inspired to play guitar because of Jimi and later the Allmans. Like most guitar players I have spent hours coping Jimis songs. Despite my honest worship of Jimi, much of his live work was many cuts below his studio efforts. He recorded 'live' in an era with poor to non-exsistant monitering systems and played at stage volumes that made recording hit or. In addition, his affection for partying and showmanship took center stage and often overshawed his playing. Want a great live recording - listen to Red House recorded 'live' in studio by the great Edie Krammer.",0
573,1,"Good book, but only for french defence starters","Im aware that very recently, and especially throughout this year (2006) there would be published really a bunch of the new french books. Added to existing Psakhis 4 volume series, would be Pedersens new works which would also close its series, and there would be Sam Collins French Advance, which to me at least tell that Everyman too would like to close its series in near future. All in all, there is all of a sudden a lot of material for advanced player.But, there are almost none for beginner. So this book is trying to accomplish that goal. Well, it succeded, but partially. As the previous rewiers noted, the lines are not perfect in every variation, but honestly, I think that is no of much significance for starters. What is more important is feeling for playing french u can catch with this book because author really explained the particularies and plans nicely.Recommended for beginers in french, best followed by Play the french from Watson.",0

575,1,simply put...it's very good,"Very few books will bring tears and laughter, but Letts managed to bring them to me over and over in ""Where the Heart Is."" her cast of characters was amazingly down-home, giving me no doubt that these characters really exist, even the bad ones. Each character was so well developed and consistent that I felt like they were reading the book to me. Not only did the book bring tears and laughter, but it also managed to hold my attention in an entire evening...I finished it in one sitting...I don't know about others, but that rarely happens with me. I reccomend this book to anyone...it will lighten their heart and brighten their day.",1
576,1,Great documentary of an American phenomenon,"I was pleasantly surprised by this well-rounded documentary that takes the viewer along on the band's final(?) summer tour. Almost no time spent on the band itself. Examines a good cross-section of heads which include a t-shirt vendor, medic, bootlegger, families on tour, young heads, old heads, a VW bus mechanic, and many for which there is no classification. Shows us the warm fuzzy side as well as the ugly side of the scene. If you were there, wish you'd been there, wish you were still there, or just want to know what this scene was all about, check out this video.",1
577,0,a frustrating book.,"This book might have the content you are looking for, but it is so tediously written that it's not worth the time. The author treats readers as if they are highschool kids.

That was almost two weeks ago. I am still waiting for a reply as they are notorious with their responses. You may want to contact NERO directly, however, I doubt if it will work.In future you may want to put some sort of safeguards in place referring to the software vendors with the description of your product(s).Otherwise, I am very satisfied with the service I have received from you as I bought many other items through you.Martha Pelensky",1

581,0,No HP anymore,"The software could be thrown away immediately - it's so buggy and dumb. The fax is unreliable - for some reason it would stop receiving faxes after a while - the unit would need resetting. HP support first sent replacement DIMM. Didn't help. Then they sent me another unit - didn't help either. Then I saw similar complaints at HP's user forum site - and I realized it's just an inherent problem having no solution. It seems like faxes are being accumulated in memory (although there's paper, and they're printed as received) and then not replaced or purged. So now I just periodically reset it ahead of time to avoid embarassment of my fax machine not being available on a regular basis.Their support site is terrible, updates are posted rarely and mostly useless, yet they bug you to respond and rate them. I'd rather they make good products so people wouldn't have to live in those forums.Overall, spare yourself trouble and look for something other than HP.",0

587,0,A lesson for all here.,Without religion it would be easy to see good men doing good things and bad men doing bad things. With religion bad men can do bad things and justify those things under the guise of religion. However good men can also do bad things behind the same religion. Here we have a fine example of either. You can pick which man you see here. Whichever way you go it does not remove the fact that BAD things have been done. That is the message of this book.,1

602,0,Disappointment from Desire,"I'd heard what a good author Ms. Jackson was and was excited to see her added to the rolls of Desire authors. I purchased ""A Little Dare"" anxious to read about an AA hero and heroine. However from the first few pages I could tell that this book did not compare to the majority of Desires. The story line is good -- woman and her son return to her home town to get him away from bad influences and run smack into her old flame AND the father of her son. However, the dialogue is unnatural and often forced. The porch scene that everyone seems to be raving about lacks sensuality that is the hallmark of the Desire line. And the love scenes embody a touch of kinkiness that aren't normally found in this line. I won't be searching out the previous book in this series nor will I purchase further books in it. All in all, it was a big disappointment and waste of good reading time.",0
603,1,Great player - Even Better Rebate,"(...). This is a great player for a first-time MP3 player buyer. The software was easy to operate and transfer music, once I realized I needed to push the USB cord into the player a little further than I had it. That cord is kind of touchy. Once it makes a connection you have to leave it alone or it will disconnect. Other than that, I've had no problems what so ever with hardware or software.The player is very light and is great for exercise. When I run, I just hold it in my hand. When I walk, I put it in my pocket. I would love to have the armband, but I can hardly justify buying the armband for almost as much as I paid for the player. I'd just as soon buy another player for the price. The battery life is also longer than they claim. I've had mine since mid-May and I've only replaced the battery once a couple of weeks ago. It still shows full power from the new battery.Once again.........a great buy!",1

It took me 2 days to get it working with a Sony VAIO. The software install disk failed and I had to manually install the drivers and the documentation provided was poor and didn't cover all the properties settings for the drivers.The worst problem is that Linksys claims this product is ""hot swappable"" which is a half-truth. You can plug it in and it will activate, but if you unplug it, then plug it in again, it will not reactivate. If you check the Linksys support FAQ, they admit ""You may require a reboot after unplugging the device"". Hardly ""hot swappable""...",0

610,1,A Corporate Merger That Works,"On their eponymous debut, Audioslave is a corporate merger that, mercifully, works. Three-quarters Rage Against the Machine (the musicians), one quarter Soundgarden (the vocalist), and the best parts of each as far as I'm concerned. Gone is the tuneless harangue of Zack de la Rocha (bye bye, don't let the door hit ya) and the caterwauling Zeppelinisms of Kim Thayil et. al. Tom Morello (guitar), Brad Wilk (drums), and Tim Commeford (bass) rock with unrepentant strength, and Chris Cornell checks his depressive tendencies at the door and - what a concept! - just wails. If there was any doubt before that Cornell's the premier metal vocalist on the planet, the one-two punch of ""Cochise"" and ""Show Me How to Live"" will banish such foolishness from your mind. And those are just the openers, with numerous highlights to follow. For those that miss de la Rocha's politics, his solo CD is coming down the pike. For the rest of us, rock lives!",1

Jetted bathtubs have about 15-20 feet of plumbing lines. These lines have warm stagnant water that is a perfect breeding ground for bacteria. Biofilm grows in the plumbing line, bacteria lives in the biofilm. Bleach, germicides, lemons, vinegar and other chemicals will not remove biofilm - see Montana University Center For Biofilm Engineering studies confirming this. It takes specialty cleaners like Oh Yuk ([...]) and other products that are specifically designed to remove biofilm. Chemical like Oh Yuk have done the research and testing confirming that bacteria has been removed from the system. If you properly remove the biofilm you have a nice safe tub.",0

If you're a fan, it's a great CD to play when you have some driving to do because you can sing along on every tune. It really makes me appreciate what a great songwriter and arranger Lionel Ritchie is. Very talented guy, and the Seventies would not have been as rich without his music. It represents what I love most about much of the music recorded then. It still sounds good after all this time! Not so sure I could say that about so much of the junk I hear on the radio these days.

621,1,A must read!,"Gaiman has created a world in London Below that is as fascinating as it is believable. Even the secondary characters are well defined and interesting, which is unusual in fantasy fiction.The main character of Richard is thrust from his ordinary life into the world of London Below by a simple act of human kindness. After a rough start, he handles the challenges a lot better than most people might. Without giving too much away, I can guarantee that you will never look at London in the same way ever again! Knightsbridge and Earls Court especially. <VBG>This book is destined to be a classic, and well worth reading two or more times in order to savor all of the details! I highly recommend this book to anyone searching for a good read with an absorbing plot, interesting characters and superior writing! Gaiman is one of my favorite writers!",1

As soon as the concert became available on video, we arrived at the store to buy it. Even though I stayed in athletics, I have sinced performed with my local college in Brigadoon, Hello Dolly, Greese, Oklahoma, and Les Miserables. In Les Miz, I graciously accepted the part of Jean Valjean, GIVEN, to me by my director/choir instructor. I hope Les Miserables can be as inspirational to others as it was to me.",1

Yeah, the albums heavier than the last few, but the heavy parts seem heavy just to prove that they're heavy. I was hoping for something good from these guys, but they've dissapointed me.

637,0,Not very funny and not very sweet,"A very 80's movie. It is almost fun to watch it for the nostalgia of all of the 80's references such as plastic furniture, shoulder pads, neon, etc. The actors are good but Martin Short is miscast in the role of a sexy leading man. His comic talent is wasted and lots of partial nudity. Martin Short is normally an extremely funny guy but he just doesn't seem comfortable with this character. The plot is really quite dull and it seems like this movie is trying to be a ""Date from Hell"" picture and trying to be a simple romantic comedy at the same time and fails at both. The screenplay is the main culprit of the death of this film but the director is also clearly at fault. One prolonged sex scene is even shot in slow motion. It makes the love scene just look silly not sexy. After watching this movie I wanted my 90 minutes back.",0

642,1,Good product,"Fabric strength is sufficient (does not tear easily) and it appears to be good for its intended function, i.e. wrapping around perforated drain pipes to prevent silt from seeping in and plugging the pipes. I did not award 5 stars because I would have used a wider roll (6 ft would have been ideal) if it had been available. I buried the pipes in crushed stone and wrapped the fabric around the outside of the stone layer to allow for better drainage. At 24"" the fabric was not wide enough and so I had to overlap 3 runs for complete coverage. Other than that, very happy with the results. Drain worked great during last rain storm.",1

This however, was not.The plot started off well, with Fiona as a tough-as-nails New York doll designer? And Ace Montgomery as a gorgeous swamp man? It already is tough to swallow, but I give it a try. It goes downhill from there. The plot and characters were constantly changing, with no reason and in the end, the whole thing made no sense.

I really liked how Sachar intertwined all the different types of characters and plots, along with linking to the past of Camp Green Lake. Because of some of the small yet sweet romantic parts, perhaps this book should not be read by students younger than 8th grade. Small Steps is a very good book and can even relay a message of why we all should take small steps, sometimes.",1

A few days before Christmas, I stopped looking. My daughter will be 3 in January. The furniture would be a great birthday gift. Wrong again!!! When Christmas morning came, my soon to be 3 year old opened her Dora dollhouse. My 5 year old then asked, ""Where's the furniture?"". I didn't even know she knew about it. What a nightmare. Now I rated the toy poorly because the kids don't even look at it. They don't play with it. It sits on the floor in the same spot for days. If I could have given lower scores, I would have.

Its very hard to slide, requiring two hands - one to hold the controller, the other to slide the switch. Makes it impossible to pop in and out of a conference call quickly by toggling the mute switch. I ended up getting aPanasonic KX-TCA60headset instead and its FAR louder.

No, it's not the least bit credible, if you stop and think about it. But it is a movie after all, so we suspend our cynical views and watch the steamroller go on to conclusion.

But those premised behaviors/interactions simply don't occur in reality, according to genuine wolf biologists, and according to genuine dog experts such as Suzanne Clothier.What's the harm? The harm is that many authors with such misconceptions recommend treatment and exercises that are harsh, unecessary, and unproductive. Worse, in some cases they can undermine trust and actually create fear.. And mistrust and fear are the primary reasons most dog bites occur.Take such instructions and falsely authoritative explanations with a grain of salt and a bit of caution.Jeff",0
670,1,CD,Arrived quickly but it is a Christmas gift and do not know what the recepient will think of the CD.,0
671,1,"Sophmore offering good, but great","I've seen Nichole in concert three times, and I adore her perspective. A liberal, accepting of all, type Christian, her music is mature and refreshing. Her second offering to me, seems a bit rushed. Wide Eyed seems more of a lifetime of delicate, intricate thoughtfulness about the words and music. Each track on Wide Eyed, serves an excellent place in the whole of the CD. Not so with This Mystery. This Mystery, Fool for You, Small Enough, Every Season, and Please Come are in true Nichole fashion. Everything else, though not horrible, feels overproduced and like a filler for the CD. I hope for her upcoming CD, due out in Fall 2002, she maintains the integrity of her gritty, yet delicate sound. Of course, vocally-I could use a bit more vibrato...She's a great person and great in concert. She holds a Bachelor's in Psychology and this is one of the reasons she writes the way she does.",1
672,1,A treasure,Taken from clips of his TV show means the film quality and sound aren't super great but good grief it is a treasure seeing this collection. I only wish it was longer with more songs from the show.,1
673,0,Not that great,"The Blu ray quality is not that great, what you would find in a standard dvd,. the footage itself is kinda week,. The interviews were good,. whoever decided to show the concert footage made some bad choice on video, I don't think they actually went to an ozzfest.",0
674,0,This is a bootleg!,"As a collector of Led Zeppelin concerts, I can affirm this release is not official. It is a bootleg. I will not go into details about the quality of the concert and recording. This should not be offered for sale. If anyone is interested in Led Zeppelin concerts, please seek out traders. Many are willing to trade with new collectors for blank CD-R's and postage.",0
675,0,A waste of money,"The plot is both weak and boring, drawn out by self indulgent scenes which separate the inevitable very predictable action. The acting is poor, with one exception, not that the script would lend itself to good acting anyhow. Camera work is mediocre. This DVD will go out in the next garage sale!",0

679,0,What a Waste!,I loved the can opener the first few times but soon found out that it won't open small cans and if your batteries are low forget getting it off the can. Several times I had to refer to the instructions to figure out how to get the can opener off the can because it was stuck. The last time nothing worked so I threw it away with the can still on it! Don't buy this but if you do keep the instructions near by as you will need them alot.,0
680,1,A mediocre movie with big name actors early in their careers.,"This movie is entertaining from the aspect that there are soo many big named actors in the movie showcased early in their careers. The plot line is thin at best and the acting in parts are just as good. The only reason I rated this movie soo high, is I lived where it was filmed and was able to see all the actors shooting scenes throughout town. For me and my town it is a cult classic as we recognize each location and scene they are at. Overall, the movie is interesting to see once for the actors strictly.",1
681,1,Great product,"My mom's crazy barking dog has had shock collars ( worked O.K. limited) had collars that make noices and hanging things (no results) has had the debarking surgery twice within a month( not so great for the $250.00 dollars and seems a bit cruel. My mom has given this spray collar a 5 star award and wished we had tried it first, especially before the surgery which she really didn't want to do and felt bad about.Try this first before anything else but I suggest that you don't let the sprayer run out. Some dogs are very smart and might catch on.",0
682,0,The product started to fall apart.,"The headset was comfortable but after 2 weeks of use, it started to fall apart. The Volume buttons were off and it just did not work. Had to return it though.",0
683,1,A helpful resource,I see more and more children facing this problem. This book focuses on the loneliness a child might feel in this situation. The character is very ashamed and is teased about his father's incarceration. The books help children to not take on the shame of the parent's crime;it is appropriate and unjudgemental. It is a helpful tool to meet the needs of a suffering child.,1
684,0,It gets old and tired after the first couple of chapters,"I really enjoyed Moore's ""Bowling for Columbine"" and highly recommend the movie. Definitely one of the top five movies of the year. After watching the film, I was interested in reading his book. Unfortunately, it didn't have the same bite and zip as his film. The book is highly anti-Bush/Republican, which is fine, however his theories and thoughts on how to change the American way of life didn't offer any new insights. Most of his suggestions were ludicrous lists that were offered up for a chuckle, which quite frankly weren't even that funny. He does this in nearly every chapter and it loses it's humor. I found myself bored towards the middle of the book, although continued to read it to the end, hoping to read some of his wit that would make the whole book worth it. Oh well, it wasn't strenuous reading and thus eased my curiosity of his writing.",0
685,0,not quite up to par,"this record is not quite up to par as a multi platnum singer has potential to make. Her less than good vocal range is really apparent when she trys to sing the lows and highs. hil needs to work with the middle octaves and not exceed her limit.the only real good song on the whole album is fly, the first single and first song on he 17 song disc. for hil, she should stick with the 10-12 song range. her voice causes pain in the ears and for me a headache trying to listen to the record once all the way through.Haters and Mr. James Dean are pointless songs that should never have been writen or recorded int he studio.i loved hils debut cd for the innocent, pop hooks and melodies that are truely lacking on her sophmore disc. Hint for buyers- if you buy, dont expect more than a little child singing kareoke at the local county fair.",0
686,1,Good,"I never had to read this in high school, so I thought I'd give it a try now. It was pretty good. I think it may have been better if I read it in high school so we could all dissect the passages, but I think I managed fairly well on my own. I thought it was a good book. I'm glad I bought it.",1
687,0,Does not filter well:(,Returned this and ordered the Pondmaster 1250 instead. Had to clean the filter every fews days in contrast to the 1250 that I celaned out weekly. SO Disappointed. You get what you pay for.,0
688,0,"""THIS is a Lindsey novel??""","I have been a great admirer and avid reader of JL novel's for many years (a few personal favorites being: Savage Thunder, Once A Princess and The Malory Novels). I was disappointed with The Heir. The characters were superficial and the story line barely kept me awake. Nothing like the Lindsey I've read in the past. Nothing. No sparks flying, no fireworks at all. I usually read a JL novel in 1 to 2 nights - this book took me 2 weeks to finish! And only because I hate starting a novel and not finishing it.Ms. Lindsey - you can definitely do better. **HINT: How about a novel on Jeremy Malory?**",0

690,1,US Air Force Flag,"I've had this flag a couple of months and am happy with it. It's seen around 2,500 miles and half of that has been in heavy winds. It seems to be a durable flag with good stitching that is holding up quite well. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is that the color doesn't wear evenly. Outside of that I am very happy with this flag.",1
691,1,Fantastic stainless steel pan,"OK it is stainless so before you review it please learn how to cook in a product without Teflon coatings. This is a really nice heavy duty pan. It heats evenly and if you set the temp right and use oils and do not put wet meats in this pan does not stick. Handle stays cool too!As for clean up...Put some hot water in it and let it soak a little. Use one of those little scrubby pads and if necessary a little barkeepers friend and voila...a very shiny great looking pan ready for yet another cooking adventure on the stove.WHat's not to like, particularly at this price!",1
692,0,Buy Your i-Pod Somewhere Else,"While the i-Pod mini is a great product, Amazon is a terrible place to buy it. They subcontract with little known etailer Wholesalersclub.com, who is insufferably slow and unreliable. Although Amazon advertises shipment within 24 hours and Wholesalersclub.com only sells i-Pods and minis, they hadn't shipped my mini after more than 10 days - and continued to stretch out the potential delivery date. They are woefully undersupplied or understaffed or simply incompetent - whatever the problem, it means that you will not get a mini ordered from Amazon any time soon.",0
693,1,Mini Player by SONY,The player is great better than an MP3 becausse you can change the contents without scrolling through folders. Two or three CDs fit on a disk. Additionally the player plays for days on one penlight battery.,1

698,1,"Great film, a classic","This animated film is definately a classic-and I would agree with Leonard Maltin-one of the best non-Disney animated films of all time. The only complaint I have is the story is abbreviated, and quite different from the Richard Adams novel. I would like to see this re-done at some point with some of the key plot-lines and characters reintroduced. Of course it would be hard-if not impossible-to capture the magic from the pages of Mr. Adams' novel. Still, this version of the movie is a valiant effort, and quite entertaining as well.",1
699,1,Cypress Keeps It Real on IV,"The months flow by, seasons change, and rappers blow up---only to disappear seemingly overnight. Such is the nature of the hip hop industry...what is hot today is old news next week.Cypress Hill are the exception to this trend. Back in 1991 they hit the scene in a big way with their first joint, containing the classics ""How I Could Just Kill a Man"" and ""Hand On The Pump"".Their latest release, IV, does not disappoint. The tracks are a lot deeper, and the flow of B Real and Sen is tight. The song topics don't deviate too much; there is plenty of cop-hating, weed smoking, and automatic weapons. The thing is, Cypress knows how to come correct and make you play the cd til you know every word.Some of the best songs on this album are ""Tequila Sunrise"", ""Lightning Strikes"", and ""Dead Men Tell No Tales"".If you like Cypress even just a little bit, go get this ablum.",1
700,1,Read it and reflect on time passing and death,I stumbled upon this book in our local library..and I'm glad I picked it up. Three days later it is done...and I can feel aspects of my own life are getting clearer now. The author was born in the 1950s and comes to terms with her beloved dad's death in the 1990s. No one is ever ready to loose a parent but your heart will break and you'll laugh out loud during the most special passages in this memoir. I don't hesitate to recommend this bittersweet testament to love in an era when dysfunctional was common and alcoholism was a secret of so many people.,1
701,1,Angelina in CGI!,"My 4-1/2-year-old daughter loves it. (Of course she is also our little ballerina - she studies ballet and that is why she is so enthralled by the character of Angelina.) She was surprised to see Angelina and Alice in a new form, not like the usual cartoons. Good animation, simple and very charming. The stories are great with gentle humor and lessons in the end.Angelina has grown up a little and is in a new school with a new teacher Ms. Mimi. My daughter misses some of the intimate characters that are familiar with her, Miss Lilly the most, and so is her little cousin Henry.",1
702,0,spotty quality,I have had mixed results with these DVDs burning slideshows out of iDVD. Some come out fine but larger ones burn okay but do not play well on some DVD players and computers. Burning the same content on other media cleared up the problems. So I have to think the problems were with these DVDs.,0
703,0,This game is bleh,"I bought this game thinking it would be just like the first one only better. It wasnt any better, infact its worse. The first outpost was kinda like a Sim City in outer space where you evolve and build your town. This outpost2 was difficult to figure out, it laged really bad later in the game, there was nothing special about it as far as being a sequal, and it was down right boring.Save yourself a few bucks and skip this one.",0
704,0,Pamuuk is the Virginia Woolf of Turkey,"I say this because both authors use the novel as a vehicle for there political/philosophical rant. Other similarities are the lack of a coherent plot and the use of silly and convoluted situations. Another similarity is in the characters... They are boring and insipid. Both authors know how to turn a phrase, but that doesn't always make for good novel. I think that too many readers con themselves into thinking that this existential ""stream of consciousness"" muddling is great literature when in actuality it is existential ""stream of consciousness"" muddling.",0
705,1,3 years and still hooked,"We love LOVE this baby wash. I have used it since my son was first born, and he will soon turn 3. It is expensive, but each bottle does last quite a long time, and its well worth it. The smell is wonderful, and doesn't last long--a good thing in my book, as I don't want him covered in scent, even a naural one. The foam is silky and rinses easily with no residue. When we use a different brand for travelling, I can always tell that his hair isn't as soft and clean as it is with his Earth Mama wash. I only wish I could afford to use it on myself too!",1
706,1,Sunny Sunflower Kitchen,"We are VERY pleased with the Sunflower kitchen. My daughter had a plastic FP kitchen, and we upgraded to this one when we moved. It's small, so it still works in our home, and it's beautifully painted and is a SOLID all wood construction. Assembly was pretty easy, and again, it's made to last. I would highly recommend it.",1
707,0,Not good,"I bought this a couple of months ago for a project I'm working on at the advice of a store employee/expert saying it was their ""best seller"".

709,0,skin type may very,"I am a medium to lite skined black woman. and i have tried many produces. this one is low on the potency side, however it did fade the specific spots i put it on by 40%-45%. you may think that's a lot but over a 6 to 8 week period it evens out. mainly my arms and upper back. my white friend tried it after i told her how it worked for me, and it too made her a bit reddish (like the woman in the prev review). she is somewhat fair skined. so i am making a huge assumption by saying it may very on skin type. but that has been my experience.",0
710,0,Really Pretty Mediocre,"Just another generic fantasy novel with a fancycover.Poorly-described characters, monsters, world. So the author hasa somewhat original magic system big deal, doesn't raise this book above the rest of the slop. Consider that a handful of reviewers that say it's the greatest book ever and they wept when they read it. Yeah right. This book is no better and no worse than the rest of the fantasy shelves that seem to cater to junior high students. This book stinks.",0

712,1,GREAT BOOK!,"This is one of the best true crime books I've ever read!! It follows the family from the parents' childhoods straight through. How Elaine Gere ever got through all this without falling apart, I will never know. It also highlights a huge crack in America's law enforcement. Michael Green should have been at the very least questioned about his suspicious activities hours before Brenda was murdered. Apparently, the cops couldn't be bothered. I read this book almost straight through at one time! I highly reccomend it!!",1

721,1,TEN TONGUES,"A strong debut volume by this terrific poet, published by Baltimore-based Three Conditions Press. Harris's poems combine honesty and elegance, rapture and turmoil, wonder and insight, frequently speaking from the perspective of an African-American gay man. They express identity, encompass history, but above all communicate the experiences of a poet leading an emotionally and imaginatively full life in today's America.These poems also teach well as examples of demanding yet accessible contemporary poetry, with students responding earnestly and enthusiastically to Harris's art.",1

Overall very disappointed with this light.",0
724,1,"Who's your daddy, Annie?","Don't get me wrong, I'm a HUGE Kid follower from 1981. I'm not giving 5 stars based solely on the choice of pieces on this compilation. His albums were very story driven, as if he were writing musicals. Taken out of context, most of these songs hold well. I wish the songs were placed in chronological order. Like I said, Kid Creole's albums were stories and the stories were linked like a grand epic that involved paternity issues, gigaloism, cannibalism, corrupt law enforcement! I think it woulda painted a better picture if told in order. If you can find the original albums, grab 'em. This greatest hits will suffice until T.P.T.B. make a boxed set!

728,0,Not impressed,"First I will say that yes, this item does keep my laptop cool. But I've had it for 6 months now and I just don't think it's that great of a product. Here are my gripes:* It is cheaply made. I have little confidence that it is going to last very long.* It is generally noisy, and every once in a while it makes a terrible groaning sound (probably the belt or something).* It is unsafe to adjust the legs while the fan is on. There have been several occasions where my fingers found their way into the fan.* The USB cord doesn't have a pass-through connector, so it uses up a port.That said, I think there are better products out there. My roommate uses the fan by Antec and it seems to be a better deal.",0
729,0,Can't count on it.,I was looking for a feeder to dispense small pellets for a medium size water garden/pond with a lot of gold fish.

When it arrived I was surprised how little feed it would hold. Only enough for a skimpy week of feeding. I set it up indoors to make sure it was set properly. It took almost a week of tweeking the settings until I was satisfied. Set it outside over the pond saw it go through one cycle before leaving on vacation. Returned to find it was still half full of feed! I have it set up again and it seems to be working but I can't trust it.,0

733,0,"Terrible, Bloody Terrible","The Dialogue in this movie is so cheesy that it made Swat look like a masterpeice. I think that is was written by some kid that dropped english before the 6th grade. The acting was, ""Oh Look We're Two Good Looking Guys Racing Around In Hot Cars, Lets Wear Tight Clothes"" sadly I think this was also the story line.This is nothing more than the studio trying to tap into pop culture and rob (and I do mean rob) the kids (watching this mindless drivel) of the nation out of their parent's money.",0
734,1,Surprisingly good,"For a generic-seeming Hollywood blockbuster, The Last Samurai was remarkably true to its subject matter. My main concern walking into it was that the director would confuse the code of the samurai with western ideas about courage and honor, disregarding the more morbid side of the tradition to present some sentimental parable about discovering yourself or being good. In fact, though, the samurai ethos is treated with enough depth, the acting and pacing is excellent, and while there is some sentimental nonsense, it restrains itself more than most films do these days. The final battle is especially impressive - the choreography, the way that deaths of important characters are treated, and some of the images which arouse real pathos.It's still nothing spectacular, though - it never really risks saying anything that hasn't been said before, or presenting some image which hasn't been seen before - but it's probably as good a movie as we could expect to be produced for a mass audience.",1

736,0,Yawn,"This Cd put me right to sleep. The pianst plays this weird rythym where he speeds up in some places and slows down in others irratically. The pianst for this album must have had trouble reading the music, because there aren't supposed to be any rests in random places. This is a fast dancing piece, hence the title: Danzas Argentinas! If you want a vison for this album, imagine a sprinter running the 400 meter dash. Suddenly the sprinter stops and walks a few paces. And then he speeds back up again, only to stop to tie his shoe. And so on. I would highly recommend another CD. Dude, Martha Argerich has an interpertation that will knock your socks off. Wahhhh!",0

740,0,Way to much fluff,"I cannot for the life of me understand why this book gets so many four star reviews, except to say three words, ""paid reviews perhaps"". This book was full of generalities and fluff. I may have gotten a few ideas, but not enough to justify the price. His push for buying a franchise instead of going it alone, I really have to question, as the failure rate for franchises these days is extremely high. All in all, this book was just not worth it. You would do better to simply read any of the latest blogs on this subject for free.",0

742,0,I want this OUT of my house.,"I received this as a gift from well-intentioned relatives. I can accept a Christian bias. Even a conservative Christian bias, but I am not going to keep such hurtful messages in my home. It goes against everything in me to destroy a book, but I don't feel right selling or donating it and subjecting some other family to this trash. Before I throw it into the recycling bin, I'm going to read every word in it so that I can never be accused of rejecting it without reading it. But then it's off to be destroyed because I would hate for my son to find this book some day and think I had accepted it's message. I read enough already to know that it's mostly the homosexuality chapter that makes me so angry, but the positive messages can be found in other, less hurtful books.",0
743,1,Excellant for someone wanting to learn the how-to's,"This book had a lot of basic information on what to do to achieve basic results. There were beautiful pictures of pop up from easy to very advanced pop ups but not all of the had the directions to do them. In the back of the book there are many,many designs with hearts and the directions to do them. It is a great book for one who wishes to learn the basic and take off on their own. I personally was looking for more designs to fool around with before I started to design myself. I plan on doing lots of hearts",1

747,0,Design flaws hold this kettle back,"Although I have enjoyed other Delonghi products this one is not a winner for me.The issue is that the lid release button is not so intuitive. The lid is designed to be released by a button in the handle. The button is integrated to make the product look clean but it's function isn't obvious nor intuitive. Many people have used this kettle at my house and they all push down on the lid to open it for filling. The lid is large and presents itself with a broad surface area and so this seems intuitive for the user. Unfortunately the little plastic latch inside can't handle the repeated stress of opening the lid by pushing on it and eventually fails. This results in the lid staying open and because of this, the temperature inside the kettle during boiling never reaches the point where the sensor triggers the kettle to switch off. I could see this as a product liability should the kettle run dry and cause a fire.",0

The acting was fine I suppose, if not bland. And the ending was just so sudden and awkward. I agree with the reviews that mentioned the running around scene, and agree that NO proper woman of that era would ever do that. Just very awkward.",0

752,1,Nice Hymnal Riff with Free Jazz enticements,"The beauty of Karma is not the Free Jazz, but rather the repetitive hymnal harmonic chord progression that is uplifting. The vocal aspect is also very nice.I have this on vinyl and recently listened to it. I can't give it 5 stars, because I can't give an album that is largely a couple of ideas taken ad nauseum 5 stars; however, I will say this: I hear some references to Coltrane's A Love Supreme in this album. It is even more uplifting in some ways than A Love Supreme, if not as influential in its scope.By the way, the LP contains all the music that this CD contains, except that it is continued on side 2.",1
753,0,Disappointing book,"The title of this book promises insights how to build architecture for embedded real-time systems. Of course the book lists lots of patterns and follows the way such patterns are usually described (Problem, Structure, Consequences). Unfortunately this list is not new at all and the descriptions are not going into a level of detail to really help in practice. E.g. in Concurrency Patterns beside others the round robin pattern and static priority pattern are described. Later under Resource Patterns the priority ceiling pattern is presented. I would recommend reading the book from Burns and Wellings or one about RMA to learn how to build real-time systems. Such books present real-time systems in a much more structured way and present the common problems and solutions in more detail. Patterns are important, but just listing patterns to fill a book is not enough.",0

This is great and can be played in the hour window of time my 2 yr old takes a nap!,1

758,0,FOR THE BIRDS,"After seeing this film at least 6 times in 45 years, I keep coming away disappointed. First, Taylor's acting is subpar and Hedren's is positively terrible, almost statuesque. It's as though she were reading Kipling's ""If"" for women before every scene. Only Taylor's mother seems to have some idea of acting. Secondly, the plot is ridiculous, unless I'm missing some sort of symbolism of mother nature rising up against man for all the harm he's caused to wildlife. If that's it, then why simply a local outbreak? Next, where is Bernard Herrmann? Perhaps, Hitchcock decided that a film lacking background music would be more effective, Strike three! Finally, the last scene with the birds quietly sequestered and our protagonists heading for a San Francisco hospital, leaves this reviewer with an empty feeling. Paying good money to stare at the cinematic equivalent of viewing a museum painting for 2 hours is just not my cup of tea. I'd rather sit and watch the grass grow.",0

Eventually one of my boys broke ours and I searched high and low to replace it eventually calling Infantino and being told that it was being improved and would come out soon. I bought the new and improved model immediately and have been cursing the day that I threw the pieces of the old away ever since. Problems with this product include 1) the gel pads do not stay put and are not very forgiving, 2) the height of the seat is all wrong for both my husband (who is average height) and me (I am short) and cannot really be adjusted 3)the seat comes off every time you try to move the contraption out of the way 4)when you try to move it all of the pieces go in different directions as they have made it too flexible for its own good.

770,1,Not perfect but I would buy again,"I have owned one for at least five years and use it whenever I'm home for the day which is weekends and holidays. It's been reliable, trouble free, and makes a good cup of coffee. It is amazingly simple compared to the other single cup brewers on the market.The included mugs (mine came with two plastic ones, not one stainless) are so so. Pretty much what you would expect for a cheap ""thermal"" mug. I just use regular 12oz coffee mugs.The permanent filter is useless. Use #2 paper filters instead, #1 filters are too small and probably why some people have spillage. Also less dripping after the brew cycle with a larger paper filter.Make sure the basket is seated correctly in the maker. If not you will end up with coffee going in the wrong places and a lot of dripping after the brew cycle.I would buy another one if mine breaks. I find myself looking for them in stores just in case I need one. All in all very good value for around $15.",0

Or with children; my 11-year-old and I watched it and laughed until we cried.Really, if you want to know in detail what's wrong with it, look at the excellent review on the Tolkein Sarcasm web page.

791,1,Horrible cover art for a great film,"Although the cover art for ""Fever Pitch"" gives one the impression that the film is some kind of soccer sex comedy, the film is actually a touching and funny account of one man's obsession with an English soccer team and how that obsession can get in the way of real life. Adapted by Nick Hornby from his excellent memoir of the same name, the film has fine performances from an able cast that includes Colin Firth. If you are an English soccer fanatic like me, the film is a must see. An American remake was made later that uses baseball as the obsession rather than soccer, but who cares?",1
792,0,I suppose I may have read worse,"The concept of a bioterrorist using the biblical plagues was a good starting point, and the opening chapter was riviting.

794,1,Greatest Progressive Rock Album of all Time,"If you are into bands similar to Pink Floyd, or Triumvirat, you will soon realize that Yes is a band you should have found out about 20 years ago. This album is very interesting, in that is goes on and off from a mellow tone, to a slightly exotic prog rock song. It starts out with a superb beginning eventually turning into a song that is so great that you will stop to realize that this record is amazing, and that it has the best bass, guitar, drums, and vocals the 70's has ever produced. This song, is Close to the Edge. BUY THIS ALBUM!!!",1

I came here to Amazon to see if I could get it on dvd, but so far, no luck.I recognized a few of the actors, notably A Martinez.

Deep digging is necessary to find how to actually set up the less than complete TA indicators although some interpretation substance is present. The book jumps around on too many markets and doesn't focus on one subset like stocks or bonds or currencies. This book hits them all with little depth on any. That is the main problem I have with this book. Too much clutter for the stock trader. All in all, I had to spend my cash (sans 16.95 for this one) on other books to learn TA. Perhaps this book caters to a more educated audience than my simple college degree and 2 years daily momo trading experience but for the individual looking for a specific market TA guide, wanting specific TA setup and use, this is not the book for you.",0

After killing an enemy you can recharge your character's health by absorbing him in dramatic fashion. That alone is worth the price of admission.

He's definitely not his Gilmore Girls character. He plays a geeky type, but totally lovable as he tries to complete the 10 Dirty Deeds in twelve hours!

Again, the graphics are amazing and that is why I will watch it once more but from there it may go on the shelf to gather ""DUST"".",1
811,1,Good book to read in bed,Title says it all. Well written and follows the TV show and a nice way to relax on a rainy day.,1
812,1,Excellent,Best thing for the price. I buy this for every one of my oil changes. I use my mobil oil with this filter and it runs my car to 8000 miles.,0
813,0,Beware,"I purchased this item through Amazon. They were great for their part. BUT the part in general was poorly made. One of the ENDS broke off after unplugging it once. Sadly this happened well after any warranty would have helped me. After all, I don't make a habit of pulling out my HDMI cird just for fun! DO NOT BUY BELKIN!",0
814,1,Great for a Good Price,"I'm a big gamer so I need to be able to hear well, be comfortable with the product being used over extended periods, and be able to be heard clearly. This headset is good for all three of those categories. The ONLY issue I have with it is the forever long cable but that's easy to fix with the twisty-tie that came with it. Good choice for the price.",1
815,1,The story of how one man's fanatcism ruined lives,"This is a very well researched account of how one man's dissatisfaction with his life and the influence of the Posse Comitatus resulted in the deaths by torture of a five year old child and a gentle, easily influenced man. The way that Mike Ryan was able to use those disenfranchised by the farm crisis to join him in his paranoid fantasy and live according to his rules is a study in abnormal psychology. As someone who came in contact with this group who lived by stealing from isolated farmsteads while purportedly carrying out God's will, I still find it a frightening story of how many ways religion can be twisted into evil deeds.I lost my copy of this book because a friend from California couldn't put it down before he had to leave!",1
816,1,Yes! for RPG on the PSP,"This game is very fun and action-packed.The game takes a smooth turn of events, the character moves quickly and stylishly making it anything but difficult or boring.It's got a straight story plot and game play is easy to follow, not making it difficult to find many things. You get items you need somewhat esily at the very early stages of the game, so it's a definite must for RPG fans out there. It has been my favorite game so far on the PSP.",1
817,0,Good for light pick-up only!,"Bought one of these for each of our kids and ourselves. For some reason, certain colors were cheaper. Red was $15 more? The first time I used it on my tile floor in the kitchen, I was satisfied but not thrilled with it's pick-up. I have dogs with long hair and didn't expect it to perform miracles just a quick clean up in between my daily vacuuming but you have to go slow with it and you do have to stop over the bigger items such as large crumbs. The first time I used it, the charge lasted 10 minutes or so and that seems to be the extent of the charge even after being left on over night. It is angled to get into corners and works great for that. Empties easily as well. Overall I would buy this again but I would pay $25 at Wal-Mart instead of the $39 I paid for it online at Amazon.",0
818,0,An Adequate Story with Average Writing,"I'm afraid I really have to agree with the reader from Dallas two messages below. There are a lot (an awful lot) of folks who hold this series in high merit, but I was barely able to finish this first book. The writing is so filled with cliches, stale dialog, and stereotypical characters that I couldn't bring myself to move on to the second book. The only saving grace was the overall plot itself was somewhat interesting.If you're just coming off of Tolkien or Jordan and are looking for further Fantasy (or if you are just used to high-quality writing), I wouldn't really recommend this series unless you can accept a novel written towards, what I would consider, an 11th-grade target audience.",0
819,1,Comfy and Stylish,"First off, these earphones are great! I've owned about 3 or 4 pairs of them. They are comfortable, stylish, versatile, and usually last me about 8-10 months. I take them with me everywhere because I never know when I will need some headphones. The only reason I gave them 4 out of 5 stars is because of one annoying aspect. When I use them while walking outside, the cord tends to stiffen, as if it freezes, when it is exposed to any temperature below 20 degrees. This can be somewhat annoying because the cord will bulge out in front of me or to the side and stay in that position until I get inside. Of course, I usually just tighten the cord a little bit while holding on to it in my pocket and that works most of the time. Again, great earphones!",1
820,1,Great Convenient Bag,"I live in NYC and this bag is great to carry or stroll on the trains. I've pulled this bag through rain and snow and it's durable and sturdy. I like the fact the bag can fold which is better than those other shopping bags with wheels that don't. I wish the handles were a bit longer, but other than that it's what I was looking for.",1
821,1,"EXCELLENT, BUT NOT VONNEGUT'S BEST","Is this book a classic? Undoubtedly. It shines, cuts and weaves its way through a wonderfully intriguing plot. Vonnegut's use of imagery is superb, his economical way with words unparelled; he richly deserved all his accolades.The only positive to come out of Kurt's passing is the renewed interest in his work. Hopefully this will inspire other authors to dare reach for the greatness that was Vonnegut.But is this Vonnegut's best work? No. If you're only checking out Vonnegut because he was recently in the news, because he died, I'd buy ""Cat's Cradle"" instead. That's Kurt's best work.Now I still feel Slaughterhouse Five was one of the 20 best books ever written. I'd rank it around number 18; Cat's Cradle would be in the top three.Cat's Cradle",1

825,1,Daevid Allen - 'Who's Afraid?' (Shimmy Disc),"I was literally amazed at how good this early '90's solo effort of Daevid Allen, the founder / eccentric frontman of Gong turned out to be. I was never even aware of this indie release until very recently. Plain and simple, 'Who's Afraid?' is good sounding and well written psychedelia. Basically,if you like the CD's Pink Floyd - 'Piper At The Gates Of Dawn', Electric Prunes - 'I Had Too Much To Dream' and Asteroid #4-'Introducing The...', you should dig this title. Turns out Allen,who's responsible for the glissando & acoustic guitar and vocals had the help of a couple of other players, Mark Kramer (of Bongwater) on bass, keyboards & vocals and David Licht on percussion. Tunes that grabbed my full attention at the first listen were ""Thinking Thoughts"" (where's the liquid light show?), ""Love"", the tripping title cut ""Who's Afraid?"", ""Pretty Teacher"" and ""Quit Yer Bulls**t"". As fun to listen to as it was to make, I'm sure.",1
826,1,Nice if you can get it working,"Got this for a client who ended up not using it. I have a Philips Voip321 Skype/Dect phone for use with land line and Skype so didn't really need it. But decided to drop the land line all together and add a second Skype number for use with this unit.All in all, it works just fine if you don't mind adding in your numbers/contacts using their feeble interface and you don't have an HD audio adapter as one reviewer pointed out. I was actually stumped on that for a while too, but have the luxury of other computers around and it tested fine on another so ended up researching and finding the mouse trail back to that info.Ya, Skype is the ""AOL"" of voip, but at $30 a year for unlimited calls to US and CA with an incoming #, voice mail and all that, I'll settle for a while longer.",0

But even at $2.99 each, that's a deal compared to what I pay at my local pet supply. It's $3.99 each there. So if I buy the 24 at $2.75, that's a savings of $1.24 ea even before taxes. Humn $1.24 x 24 = $29.76. Don't know where everyone has been shopping, but if you can find me a better deal, let me know. As soon as I get an extra $66, I'm biting on it - so to speak.",0

Dreadful cinematography on numerous occassions incl over and under exposure and out of focus scenes.This film is so devoid of everything that should make a good film.The underground car park scene and some of the bedrom scenes between the male and female,have a dreadful red glow as if someone turned on a huge red light-resulting in the very worst in cinematography I have ever seen.This is a film which has nothing going for it.",0

839,0,Not enough wood ; too much trees,"I am having some issues developing an application using Swing and this book is helping me very little. Its biggest problem right now for me is that it doesn't have a section covering layout managers -- quite amazing for a book of over 1600 pages supposedly dedicated to Swing. Maybe layout managers aren't technically part of Swing (??), but they should be in here.In general, there is a lot of information in this book which doesn't help me much, or is no more than is available free from Sun's website. The information I really need in order to understand Swing and solve my problems -- such as how the layout managers work and how the virtual machine decides when to execute queued GUI requests -- are either not here at all or so deeply embedded within a mass of superfluous information as to be useless. I'm going to return my copy.",0

I kept looking-up ""Caleb Carr"" on this site and last summer I pre-ordered this book and waited longingly to receive it. I am, as many others are, disappointed. I couldn't get into the characters and the ""techie"" future. It may be a good book in and of itself--but as a Carr fan it just seemed wrong. Sci-fi fans will probably enjoy it. I can only hope that we will see more of him in the style we've loved for years. It is definately not a book I would have bought if Carr's name wasn't on it. PS--Did anyone else notice Carr sitting at the bar in the movie 200 Cigarettes?",0

The CD reminds me of Britney Spear-Me, N-Sunk, Backroad Kids, Who, Dave Edmonds, Lets Active, Strawberry Alarm Clock, Lolipop Shoppe, the Raiders, Big Star, and all the other POPers from the 60's 70's and today. No lyrical meanings, except ""Let's get drunk and listen to this POP ... while we get wasted""! If you want to hear REAL music, buy Journey's Greatest Hits CD. I promise you, they define what REAL MUSIC was AND STILL IS all about!...",0
847,1,Eye-opening production!,"This is an eye-opening production. Not only can it destroy the oft-held impression that opera is boring and static, it shows how powerful and emotionally shattering a first class opera production can be, even when viewed at home in a small TV screen. The standard of acting here is superb and that for the singing is almost as good. The sound and picture quality, while not of today's best standards (this production is filmed in 1979 and 1980), is better than good. What an enjoyable set of DVDs!",1
848,0,Not so great,"I have use it for 2 weeks and find it no where as good as floss. The only place it works is between the teeth at the gum line and that is not very well.

850,0,File format problems,"This product is only capable to format a hard drive in FAT32 format. This is neither the standard for the PC nor the Mac. If you have a pure PC or Mac network, I advise getting a NAS that uses the appropriate format.The FAT32 format only makes sense if you use it as a cross-platform NAS.

We have many Sesame Street videos that she asks to watch very often but when I put this one on for her she was not happy.First off, Elmo, Telly & the 2 little girls are hardly in it. The video tape mostly shows the little cartoon skits. That's usually fine but on this tape it's back to back skits with hardly any Muppets in between them.My daughter quickly became bored and actually asked me for a book while this tape was on.Something she has NEVER done while Sesame Street tapes are on! It simply could not hold her attention.If you want a good Sesame Street Counting tape try ""1,2,3 Count With Me"".It doesn't have Elmo in it but features Ernie instead. That one holds her attention and she's learning how to count because of it.",0

857,0,"Disappointing, though slightly redeeming at the end","Speed of Darkness is one of the most original Starcraft novels to date, keeping its focus more on ""new"" characters rather than following the heroes of the Starcraft computer game. Yet even with the fresh cast, the book sufferes from so many sci-fi cliches and overused plotlines that it does not feel original. Combine that with stereotypical characters and a protagonist most readers won't like (or identify with) throughout most of the novel and you've got a book that, in my opinion, isn't worth reading.Still, the last ""scene"" of the book is well done, and will give hardcore fans a brief reprieve from the feeling that they've wasted their money. It is not, however, good enough for me to recommend this book to anyone I know (and like).",0

860,0,Fairly weak,"This book just isn't up to the standard of the other episodes in the BrainShip series. The plot and the characters show promise, but the polish and fun of the other books is missing. The main villian is absolutely flat and serves mainly as a blatent plot device. The various logic inconsistancies pile up until the plot collapses totally about 75% of the way into the story. I also noticed a large number of editing errors. ""ass"" instead of ""ask"", ""hum"" instead of ""him"", and so forth. Not recommended for anybody but a die-hard fan.",0

886,0,This one could make you wanna go straight,"I agree with another reviewer when they wrote 'The only reason I even gave it 2 stars, is because it has ""lesbian"" anything in it...' I watched it with a friend and we both found it a totally depressing watch. Most the story lines are so negative that it makes you wonder if you should go straight. And the ones left over are killed by the dire production values. In what could be seen as a less than community minded act, after one watch I put it straight onto out local online auction site as i couldn't even be bothered having it my lesbian DVD collection its so annoying.",0

888,1,"""Gleek"" review","Loved being able to watch Glee without all the annoying, distracting commercials. Was already a fan before buying Vol.1; am now an official ""Gleek"". Even with all the angst, rivalries, and love triangles, the great performances by the kids of Glee Club are uplifting & entertaining. The choreography and musical arrangements are fresh and dazzling. Even better is that the casting of these relative unknowns have developed an amazing chemistry that makes everything work. I feel this ensemble cast will become a famous part of TV history similar to Cheers, Seinfeld, Friends, etc. Can't wait until the beginning of the next episodes in April.",1
889,0,Editing FAIL,"I HAVE an old hardcover copy of this great book, I just wanted a paperback to make notes in. But this edition is enough to make you think you woke up in an alternate universe, where the spelling and punctuation rules are similar to ours, but just not quite the same. Paragraphs and sentences end in the middle; the rest evidently lost in space. On the first page of Book One, Arabia is spelled Arabh, and instead of flank-threat, it's spelled fink-threat. Commas have vanished. This is a cut and paste job done by aliens! Please shop around for a better edited book. I'm returning this one.",0

Well, I finally decided I'd waited long enough to get it, and so, even though my money was tight, I said, ""What the heck; I'm going to finally get it!"" I couldn't wait to hear it. Boy, was I disappointed! It's been a BIG mistake! I am now going to return it. Maybe one of the others is good, but I definitely would not recommend this one!!",0
891,0,NOT squirrel proof,"I had high hopes for this feeder, based off others' reviews. However, our resident squirrel must be too wiley for this feeder. It still manages to cling to the tree, lean on the bar and eat out of the ports without the door closing (will try placing it further out on a branch away from the tree--). I just noticed the spring adjustment when I went out to refill it. Will see if adjusting it solves the issue regarding the trap door closing sufficiently. May contact the company regarding this feature; it is the whole reason I bought this feeder. Debating returning it. Otherwise, seems to be sturdy construction. Will update this review.UPDATE 10/31/2012:This morning, a week after purchase (even with a baffle hanging above the feeder), a squirrel managed to knock down and break the acrylic panel on the side of the feeder, spilling seed onto the ground. Back it goes.",0

After reading this book, the truth about Wal-mart is here -- every bit as scary as I imagined. Inside the book, Quinn supports his anti-Walmart message with FACTS and ACTUAL EVENTS and LAWSUITS, showing us why the last thing you should want in your community is the [is the local] store, because that will basically mean the end of your community. From horrible treatment of workers, low wages, lack of community involvement, destruction of the environment, lack of respect for ecology, willful destruction of competitors and misuse of its OWN CUSTOMERS, Wal-mart has done it all. Its high time we stop supporting them. Read this book, do something about Wal-mart, we can make a difference.",1
893,1,Rhapsodie espagñole,"(Review of the 1988 disc that makes up half this collection)This is a stunner - some of the best Liszt playing I have heard. The rollicking aragonesca of the ""Rhapsodie"" inspires Hough to alpine feats of prestidigitation. I laughed with astonishment when I heard it. But for all of his super-pianism, his hallmark is control and refinement of tone. He's very much in the Earl Wild mold. Like Wild, his playing can verge at times on the precious as he strives for too delicate an effect. We never forget, however, that a unique intellect is at work. Our few misgivings pale beside music-making of this stature.",1

The great vocals of Opera with great powerful music of Metal.This album should be in everyone's library, if you like opera and heavy metal you need to see how they are joined into a masterpiece. Therion completes Heavy Metal and Opera!",1

If you are expecting to use this to record vocals, caveat emptor.However, I've had better luck using this as a guitar preamp after removing the chinese 12AX7 tube and replacing it with a Grooves Tubes Gold. It is running into a cheap solid state practice amp and has vastly improved the sound. Crank both the knobs and you will get a nice tube saturation, albeit with a noticeable hum. For $30, this really improved the sound of my mediocre guitar amp.In short, change the tube and you might find some nice guitar tones.",0

Re-locating it to the forward handle would be a big help and ensure that the operator keeps both hands on the saw when starting it. I found myself using my left index finger to press the ""safety"" button to start each cut, therby removing my L hand from the saw. My right thumb is too large to work the [safety] button.",0

927,1,It's a good private detective book,"I enjoyed this novel, even though at it's heart it is just a fairly standard ex-cop detective novel. It's a nice angle to have an ex-cop who specialises in the gambling industry, particularly casino hustlers & swindlers.There are elements of humour although I would've like more. I would've also liked Swain to have written more about the casino games. There's the occasional predictable cringe worthy cliche (e.g. Valentine ripping up his boxing betting ticket) but overall it's pretty entertaining.",1

Topics like automata and removing nondeterminisim are not explained well enough(only one non-sense example for nondeterminism). Awful diagrams. It is not going step by step to understand Prolog and Lex. In short, if you have choice don't buy the book and if you have bought it already, don't waste time reading it. Unfortunately, I had not other option, I have bought the book and am reading it.",0
929,1,A READER WHO KNOWS,"'Realms of the Gods' was better than imaginable. It had all of the elements that a well written book should have. Adventure, romance, and even a little bit of mystery. My only regret about this book was that it was the final book in the 'Immortals' series. Luckly, this book answered all of the readers unanswered questions and tied up all of the loose ends.

This book was mysterious and involving, without being introverting. It was incredibly good. The book takes you though a great description of the characters and their life, which turns more into a living nightmare for the main character. The end is as surprising as it gets - I had to read the last 2 pages a few times to make sure I understood it right - it was the last thing I could have ever expected! I am trying to forget a bit about this book so I can read it again, but it's so peculiar and written so well that it's hard to forget. I rarely read a book which I liked from beginning to end - actually, I never did, until I read this one! An absolute must for anyone who is into mystery books.",1

934,1,book 2 A Clash of Kings A Song of Ice and Fire,"I don't usually read fantasy preferring biography, non fiction and more literary fiction. But I am quite intrigued now by this well written tale that transports one to a time like the middle ages with all shades of darkness and light in the portrayed characters and events naturalistically described. The story is gripping. Our senses become engaged with rich descriptions of varied rugged landscapes and castles, clothing colours and textures, sumptuous foods and delightful details, often raw... of human engagement with the loving qualities of the animal kingdom and human interaction sometimes tender more often brutal.It did not matter one bit that I lost track of who all the knights were with their differing allegiances. The main characters remained as large as life.Travelling Europe as I am now, my eyes are honing in on all that is medieval... I'm now bereft though without my read so must purchase book 3 tomorrow.",1

The only solution was to plug them into another power source, which did nothing to improve the problem.The Logitech website solution was to return them for a replacement, which is exactly what I am doing.

961,0,Doesn't work half the time,I hooked up one of the monitors while my husband was remodeling a bedroom. Went to the store and came home and my 7 month old was hoarse from crying. The thing wasn't working. The other monitor doesn't work half the time either.,0
962,1,This stuff works,"yes, this product works and it works well, without harming your pet. My dog actually enjoys the brushing from the ferminator, I think its like a massage to dogs. Only downside is that it makes a mess in the house so if you can groom your pet outdoor.",1
963,1,Great product,"I'm finally getting the hang of these, I might be unable to go without one now.I have tried several different makeup sponges and this one is a good texture, not to stiff but it still seems like it will hold up for a while. Happy with the purchase.",1
964,1,Charming Puritan tale for older children,"In 1705, a Puritan tomboy's world is shattered when her mother is captured in an Indian raid, but she stays with a kind pastor's family and sees how useful the womanly skills are that she has scorned.Mostly likable characters in a story that moves right along, and the few historical flaws (such as a Puritan mother allowing her daughter to abandon housewifery to play with her brothers) would not affect young readers. The formatting is fine, and the charming black-and-white illustrations showed up well even on my Kindle for Android phone. Good story for somewhat advanced readers, comparable to the Bobbsey Twins books in length and vocabulary.",1
965,0,Who Cut Out The Cheese?,"I don't see how they can get away with calling it 'blue cheese'. I cannot taste any cheese chunks in this particular dressing. Calling it ranch seems more appropriate. This appeared to be the predominant flavor throughout.I know this is one of the 'budget' salad dressings available in the local grocery store. And it might explain the composition.But because Kraft is obviously famous for producing cheese products, they should put a little more work into this particular item. They could probably do it.",0
966,0,Piece of Junk,"Didn't work, and is a useless gadget. Turns out the airlines (at least in Business Class) will provide a loaner, so you really don't need it anyway.",0
967,0,I WISH I WAS DEAF AFTER LISTENING TO THIS!,"The sound you hear is Def Leppard hitting bottom. I'm amazed by all the good reviews here. Is everyone tone deaf? This is the weakest album I have ever heard. I can't believe this is the same band that made Pyromania and Hysteria. This album sorta sounds like Adrenalize, which isn't really a good thing. If you're thinking of buying this, don't. Ignore all the biased 4 and 5 star reviews. I have over 450 cd's of various music and this is one of the worst cd's I have. No kidding!",0
968,0,former fan disappointed,"I have been trying to slog through this book, and got to wondering if it was just me or if others have found it as difficult to read as I have. On previous occasions I have stayed up all night to read a Ludlum book. This one is a struggle to force myself back to. I was almost relieved when I checked the Amazon site and found most other reviewers feeling the same way. The dialog is terrible. So far I have only made it to page 124 and I am already weary of the italics and the phrase ""I see what you mean"". I even went back to some of Ludlum's previous works to check and see if they were as good as I remembered or if my tastes were now more particular. Nope. The others were great. Is this really the great Ludlum or is someone else writing under his name?",0
969,1,Great acting!!!,This show was so fantastic that I watched 2 whole seasons in less than 2 weeks on demand. I can't wait for season 3!!,1
970,1,Sutherland sings like an angel!,"With ravishing bell-like tones, you can almost see a halo on top of Joan Sutheland's head. What passion, what a gorgeous sound she makes! Just sends chills up and down one's spine. The recording is wonderful, the choir brilliant, and the supporting cast is excellent. But Sutherland is the vocal miracle!",1
971,1,Good Aussie movie,"As an Australian and some one who is not interested in war films, The Odd Angry Shot is still my favourite film of all time. The writing and direction are superb and the acting very natural. The characters draw you in and you become involved in the story. While it is not the best or most popular Aussie movie, it is still my favourite and one that fans of film should see.",1
972,0,Civ 4 Let down!,"This game was hyped from the get go...Look at the first post, well before it was released.I received the game which locked up as it has major problems with ATI video cards.Also, with my new alienware laptop where the inital load movie plays it jumps and pops like pop corn.It's like this game wasnt even play tested. Very disappointed.Don't buy this game until a patch is released!",0
973,1,A little loose. But probably as good as they get.,It does what it is supposed to but fits a little loose allowing my cargo carrier to sag a little more then it would without requiring an adapter. I'm using it with a Valley Class II Hitch and a Valley Cargo Carrier on a 2007 Dodge Caliber SXT. It is probably as good as they come though...,1
974,1,Loving this watch.,"This watch is cute and easy to use. Have dropped and banged it and still works great. Swim, ride and run with it. Wish i could find different bands to have variety.",1
975,1,Dogs are NOT furry children,"I have had an earlier version of this and have ordered the latest. I have used methods in this book to raise and train four Dobermans and a Great Dane. As others have said, the negative reviews come from people who have not read the book (one admits just flipping through it in a bookstore) or did not absorb what they read or have bought into the notion that dogs are really furry children. You can discipline your dog (or child) physically without being cruel. Sometimes for your safety or the dogs behavior must be corrected immediately. A physical reprimand (smack undeer the chin) is the fastest way to make your point. As others have also noted, there is so much more to this book than just dog training. The monks are kind, compassionate men who have developed an unmatched understanding of dog behavior through years of study and interaction with them and they convey that knowledge in clear, charming prose. Anyone with a dog or planning to get one should own this book.",1
976,0,WARNING: Made in China!,"I was just about to give these to my dogs and realized that they are made in China. Unfortunately I realized too late and cannot return them. In the trash they go. They could be a good product, but I'm not going to take a chance. I've heard too many scary stories about treats and food from China. My pets are not worth taking that risk with.",0
977,0,Very disappointing,"I purchased 5 of these timers. Of the 4 I've set up, 3 of them have problems with timing (run too often, unrelated to the program I've set up). The 4th had a leaky gasket and filled with water so I'm not sure whether the timer worked correctly or not. The customer service person was frustrated the two times I called but has agreed to replace the units. Now that I see the problems others have had, I may save myself some hassle and find an alternative product.",0
978,0,"Disjointed, confusing film","I feel a little flimflammed having just purchased this film. I'm a huge Mozart fan and thought this might be an interesting variant on Mozart's wonderful Magic Flute.I'm still trying to figure out what the director was attempting to accomplish. It's a confusing, incomprehensible mishmash of poor acting and chopped up opera.Warren Christie would be a sensation in a high school play, but he's awful as Tom/Tamino. The only decent actor is the Monostatos character.DO NOT waste your hard-earned cash on this disaster.",0
979,0,"Haughty, Smarmy , Preachy , Holier than Thou.","If you like to read a book that assumes you are an inferior dolt who can't possibly comprehend the life of this presumuptious social climbing political opportunist, then this book is for you.",0
980,0,A Review for Sandison's Che Guevara,"Mr. Sandison's book about Ernesto Che Guevara gave much to the reader as far as wonderful photographs are concerned, one even hangs on my wall. Why, then, would he publish a book that contains many grammatical errors and even some factual ones as well? At least I have a nice picture to look at while I ponder this question.",1
981,0,Very Average,"When Damien Lewis played Major Winter in Band of Brothers he was convincing as an Englishman playing an American; but the Flt Sgt in this film was awful. His accent was wrong, his manner wrong and it was cartoonish. A British pilot would expect to be shot down behind enemy lines - reconnaissance planes were unarmed - he would know how to behave and certainly would not be discussing American Presidents.This made the film cretinous and it lacked the edge of films like Stalingrad, Kokoda - 39th Battalion, or even Battle of The Bulge. It was not crisp and lacked tightness - and the Stand-Up Comedian playing the British RAF pilot - Kirby Heyborne - he was simply awful",0
982,1,Fun and Challenging Games,"This game is one of the first ones Her Interactive created, so it isn't as enhanced as the later ones, however it is a lot of fun and makes you think about your next move.",1
983,1,Works great,"Purchased this to replace the one that was on our feeder originally that my husband somehow managed to knock over with the lawn mower and break. It attached using the exact same holes from the original so no having to drill new holes. The only thing I see as different from the picture is that the wire guard is not exactly as shown. Mine is only about 1/2 the height as the picture, only 2 time around with the wire instead of the 4 shown. That's better for me because we had a big problem with squirrels trying to get to the spinner part. The connections for all of the wires for the various attachments is labeled very clearly so it was really easy to connect the new solar panel/charger to it. Was a breeze to hook up.",0
984,0,DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!,"I WAS HOPING THAT THE OTHER NEGATIVE REVIEWS WERE WRONG, BUT THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO ME. THE THERMOMETER SEEMED TO WORK WHEN I TOOK IT OUT OF THE BOX, BUT HALFWAY THROUGH USING IT THE FIRST TIME, IT STARTED BEEPING INCESSANTLY. I TRIED THE RESET BUTTONS ON BOTH THE TRANSMITTER AND RECEIVER BUT NO LUCK - THE THING JUST KEEPS BEEPING AND FLASHING 199 DEGREES. NOT ONLY WAS THE MANUFACTURER NOT ABLE TO OFFER ANY TROUBLESHOOTING HELP WHATSOEVER, BUT THEY WANTED ME TO PAY TO SHIP THEIR DEFECTIVE PRODUCT BACK TO THEM FOR REPLACEMENT.",0
985,0,"OK, BUT NOT WORTH THE MONEY",I ACTUALLY RETURNED THIS ITEM AFTER I USED IT ONLY ONCE. OUT OF THE BOX (AFTER THE FIRST CHARGE) IT DID NOT WORK. I TOOK THE BATTERY COVER OFF AND FOUND THAT ONE OF THE LEADS WAS DISCONNECTED. ONCE I GOT PAST THAT ISSUE I BEGAN USING IT IN OUR KITCHEN. AFTER ABOUT 5 MINUTES THE POWER BEGAN TO DIMINISH. AT FULL CHARGE IT PICKED UP DIRT VERY WELL BUT THE POORLY DESIGNED EXTENSION TUBES KEPT COMING APART. BASICALLY THIS VACUUM NOT AT ALL WHAT I HAD EXPECTED.,0
986,1,great deal for box lovers,8 beautiful boxes 2 plain but interesting boxes. only 3 or 4 a good size for a cigar box guitar. still a great deal. I am very pleased with my purchase. It would be a good idea for seller to have a selection just for cigar box guitar & cigar box amplifier makers. Maybe a gruoping for people that just love pretty boxes.,1
987,0,HARMAN YOUR TECHNICAL SUPPORT DISAPPOINTED ME!!,"I WAS USED THIS DVD `PLAYER FOR ABOUT 2MONTHS, THEN I COULD'NT READ MY MP3 CD, AFTER A WEEK EVEN MY MUSIC'S CD AND DVD'S WASN'T ABLE TO PLAY, I WROTE AN EMIAL TO HARMAN'S SUPPORT, THEY ANSWER ME AFTER 2 WEEKS!!, AND EACH EMAIL FORWARDED WAS ANSWERED AFTER 1 OR 2 WEEKS.",0
988,1,A Nursery Must Have,"We got this from our registry and it has been in our nursery since the day our 4 month old came home from the hospital. It does a nice job containing all of his dirty diapers. my only problem was that there was no way to tell it was full until you tried to turn the lever and it wouldn't move. Otherwise I wouldn't think of having another gadget like this one. It uses the tall kitchen bags like our kitchen trash can uses, no need to buy special bags. and it keeps the smells contained. we love it!",1
989,0,"Good product, poor packaging",Half of the bag was all inside the mailing box due to poor packaging. The product itself is good though.,1
990,0,Mr. Clean Magic Eraser Cleaning Pads,I was not impressed. I would not order this again. They do not last long and do not do the job.,0
991,0,There have to be better books on miscarriage...,"I was lent this book by a friend, so at least I didn't waste my money on it. My two main complaints are (1) I have a very hard time trusting an author who admits that she tricked her husband into pregnancy, and (2) the text is very repetetive, saying the same things, over and over and over, leaving me to wonder whether this was necessary to make a book out of what amounts to little substance.",0
992,0,Hose Connector Assembly Cracks,"The hose connector assembly that passes through the frame into the hub of the reel and connects to the hose has stress cracks running longitudinally through the black tube of the connector. These cracks result in unacceptable leakage. I checked on the latest Suncast Hose Reel Carts and they use the same style connector. This is a part that is easily replaceable if replacement parts are made available. Ideally the part that cracks should be made of a thicker, stronger plastic. At first I was tempted simply to discard the hose reel with the cracked part, but when I saw the apparently same part on the new reels, I decided to bring it to your attention. Thank you for the opportunity to voice my concern about one of your products.",0
993,1,Nintendo product,5 Star for company and product and Amazon. I would recommend this company to anyone wanting good products and service.,1
994,0,Book of Mormon Fiction for the Latter-day Saint reader,"The authors have been studying the Book of Mormon, and have come up with the idea that the Nephites were never completely destroyed by the native Americans (Lamanites), but sailed off to Japan and intermarried with the people there. As soon as the people of Japan find out their real heritage, they will come to America to build the New Jerusalem in Jackson Missouri. The Lamanites, can join in on the building if they wish, but the promises of Christ are that the Nephites (Japanese) will be building the New Jerusalem. The authors make the presentation of their ideas more interesting by putting them in the form of fiction. The title itself tries to remind you that this is a novel and not just a series of lectures. The effect this book had on me: I want to read The Book of Mormon again, this time more carefully, with a view of prophecies of my day.",1
995,1,Amazing Book!,"This book is fascinating- told from death's perspective, you get a good overview of many characters you might not otherwise have in a novel. And the price was definitely reasonable!",1
996,1,Funny...,"Hilarious is all I can say... This movie is straight bafoonery but in a ""Martin"" and ""Fresh Prince of Bel Air"" kind of way! I appreciate the use of satire and creative writing to add a bit of twist to your not so ordinary film. I would and will recommend this movie because it's straight comedy. Much support to the cast and the peoples that made this happen.",1
997,0,AWFUL!!,"I READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING PRODUCT, I STILL BOUGHT IT ANYWAY... I READ THE DIRECTIONS TO A TEE AND IT STILL TOOK ME ABOUT 1.5 HOURS TO PUT TOGETHER. MY THUMBS HURT SO SO BAD. I CUT MY FINGER AND BENT A NAIL BACKWARDS GETTING THIS TOGETHER. THEN WHEN IT WAS FULLY TOGETHER I WAS MISSING A WHEEL!!! I WOULD RATHER HAD PLASTIC DRAWERS FROM WALMART THEN THIS... GOOD LUCK!",0
998,1,Newbies to Dir en Grey be warned,"I love Dir en Grey and adore this album, but I will tell you I had mininul exposure to their music when I heard this album and I was nearly scarred away from the band. After listening to it over and over (as well as hearing other singles), this album grew on me and I now love it.Those that are new to Dir en Grey SHOULD NOT listen to this album first. It is extremely dark, hardcore and can be a it disturbing. Though some may be able to handle it, it's best to listen to the Macrabe or Vulgar albums to get a better taste of their style first before sixUGLY.I still highly reccomend this album- especially if you're really upset and need mood music. This album's perfect. ^_^",1
999,0,Overhyped film of the decade,"Truly a nothing film. The only thing I like about this film is that it offended tight-wad Christians. Might appeal to wine snobs as much time is wasted pontificating about wine. I am in complete agreement with the review below this one.The only possible benefit to watching this film would be receiving an improved outlook on your own life after witnessing a few losers and morons cluelessly attempting to negotiate their pitiable, uninteresting lives.",0
